It reviews substantial new evidence on locoregional and systemic therapies for \\nearly and advanced breast cancer and in situ carcinoma. In breast cancer, the treat-\\nment strategy is chosen based on the features and biology of the tumor and on the \\npatient’s age, general health status, and personal preferences. The decision options \\nin this edition of the book are based on the best evidence-based recommendations \\navailable. The majority of breast cancer deaths now occur in less developed regions \\nof the world. The gold standard for breast cancer care includes an integrated multi-\\ndisciplinary team approach comprising pathologists, radiologists, surgical oncolo-\\ngists, medical oncologists, radiation oncologists, oncology nurses, and plastic \\nsurgeons. The first chapter comprises decision pathways outlining the step-by-step \\nclinical decision-making process for patient management. In the subsequent chap-\\nters, the recommendations are discussed in light of randomized trials.\\nIstanbul, Turkey Adnan\\xa0Aydiner\\nIstanbul, Turkey  Abdullah\\xa0Igci \\nPittsburgh, PA, USA

Surgical treatment is performed in high- risk patients or if there are familial risk factors for lobular carcinoma \\nLCIS; chemoprevention is the choice in other patients. Patients with LCIS lesions detected by imaging methods are gener-\\nally considered as higher-risk LCIS. DCIS treatment options should be applied in cases with the pleomorphic subtype of \\nLCIS. Florid LCIS is a newly defined subtype that is suggested to be managed like pleomorphic LCIS. Multifocal LCIS (>4 \\nterminal ductal lobular unit involvement) may be associated with higher risk for recurrence and invasive cancer.

The \\nspecimen should be evaluated with X-ray imaging. Radiation therapy (RT) after breast-conserving surgery is the standard treatment \\nin DCIS. The disease-free surgical margin should be adequate (≥2\\xa0mm) [1–3]. At the St Gallen 2017 consensus meeting, a few \\nresearchers stated that “no ink on margin” may be considered sufficient in selected cases, whereas a surgical margin of 2\\xa0mm and \\nabove is considered safe in patients with DCIS undergoing breast-conserving surgery (BCS). In cases undergoing BCS, a surgical \\nmargin of 2\\xa0mm or above is considered safe only in those with DCIS. If the invasive tumor is <1\\xa0mm in DCIS, the surgical border \\nsafety is evaluated according to DCIS. If the invasive focus is >1\\xa0mm in DCIS, the surgical margin width should be evaluated accord-\\ning to the invasive cancer. A sufficient surgical margin should be decided together with clinical, radiological and pathological find-\\nings. The decision regarding the “sufficient surgical margin” should be made according to findings such as additional radiological \\nfoci (multiple foci, microcalcification), invasive lobular carcinoma, presence of more than one surgical margin and persistence of \\nsurgical marginal proximity in re-excision. bER-positive, postmenopausal case, advanced age, low-grade tumors\\n10 A.

Relative con-\\ntraindications include tumor size >5\\xa0cm, prior radiation therapy, active connective tissue disease, focally positive margins, and a known or suspected genetic \\npredisposition to breast cancer. According to the St. Gallen 2017 consensus meeting, multifocal tumors can be treated with BCS “provided that the margins are \\nclear and that whole breast radiotherapy (RT) is planned” [3]. A meta-analysis reported that the risk of local-regional recurrence after nipple-c onserving surgery \\nwas very low [19]. At the consensus meeting, it was stated that nipple- conserving surgery can be performed in patients with hereditary BRCA1/2 mutations if \\nthe retroareolar tissue is determined to be clean by a pathologist [3]. bIn women undergoing BCS for invasive BC and proceeding to standard RT and adjuvant \\nsystemic therapy, the minimum acceptable surgical margin is “no ink on invasive tumor” [1–3, 20]. Tumor biology or patient age (<40) does not change the \\nminimum acceptable surgical margins. cFor BCS: According to the ACOSOG Z-11 study, if adjuvant whole-breast RT and systemic treatment will be given to \\nthe patient with macrometastasis in 1–2 sentinel lymph nodes, complete axillary dissection may not be performed regardless of tumor biology [15]. According \\nto the 2017 St Gallen consensus, “standard tangential” or “high tangential” RT can be given to these cases, and there is no special preference [3]. dFor mastec-\\ntomy: Complete axillary dissection should be performed in patients with macrometastases in 1–2 sentinel lymph nodes if adjuvant RT is not planned. However, \\nthere is no complete consensus regarding the omission of axillary dissection in patients for whom RT has been planned [3]. eIn a multidisciplinary consensus \\npanel, margin widths and ipsilateral breast tumor recurrence (IBTR) were reviewed in 33 studies including 28,162 patients [20]. Positive margins (ink on \\ninvasive carcinoma or ductal carcinoma in situ) were associated with a twofold increase in the risk of IBTR compared with negative margins. This increased \\n(continued)\\n18 A. Aydiner et al.\\nFig. 1.10 (continued)\\nrisk was not mitigated by favorable biology, endocrine therapy, or a radiation boost. More widely clear margins than no ink on tumor do not significantly \\ndecrease the rate of IBTR compared with “no ink on tumor”. No evidence indicates that more widely clear margins reduce IBTR in young patients or in those \\nwith unfavorable biology, lobular cancers, or cancers with an extensive intraductal component. The authors concluded that the use of “no ink on tumor” is the \\nstandard for adequate margins in invasive cancer but not in DCIS.\\xa0During the operation, it is best to perform the incision macroscopically 1\\xa0cm around the \\ntumor. Postoperative MR imaging is appropriate for patients with tumors in close proximity to the surgical margin. In cases undergoing BCS, a surgical margin \\nof 2\\xa0mm or greater is considered safe only in those with DCIS.\\xa0If the invasive tumor is <1\\xa0mm in DCIS, the surgical border safety is evaluated according to \\nDCIS.\\xa0If the invasive focus is >1\\xa0mm in DCIS, the surgical margin width should be evaluated according to the invasive cancer. An adequate surgical margin \\nshould be decided by clinical, radiological and pathological evaluation. A “sufficient surgical margin” should be decided according to findings such as radio-\\nlogical additional foci (multifocal disease, microcalcification), invasive lobular carcinoma, multiple surgical margin involvement and persistent proximity of \\nsurgical margins in re-excision [2, 20]. fNeoadjuvant chemotherapy is recommended for patients with axillary lymph node-positive T1–T3 tumors and axillary \\nlymph node-negative T2–T3 tumors with triple-negative or HER2-positive tumors [1, 3, 5, 12]. In Luminal B tumors, chemotherapy can be considered a prior-\\nity. Neoadjuvant hormone therapy alone may be considered to avoid mastectomy in node-negative select patients (i.e., patients with strong hormone receptor \\npositivity, advanced age, or poor performance status). Neoadjuvant hormonotherapy should last for 6–8\\xa0months, as long as the patient responds. The addition \\nof hormonal agents to neoadjuvant chemotherapy can be made with a low level of evidence. Importantly, the guidelines emphasize that addition of endocrine \\ntherapy is not based on direct evidence. Additionally, they provide no reason why endocrine therapy should be delayed until completion of cytotoxic treatment \\n[1, 3, 6, 12]. Tamoxifen as endocrine therapy should not be given with chemotherapy. When neoadjuvant chemotherapy is given, the use of chemotherapy in \\nhigh-risk patients with very strong hormone-receptor positivity, aromatase inhibitors in the postmenopausal stage, and medical oophorectomy in the premeno-\\npausal stage [± aromatase inhibitor, especially in HER2-p ositive patients] may be considered (proposal 3)\\n1 Decision Pathways in\\xa0Breast Cancer Management 19\\n Invasive Breast Cancer: Pathological Evaluation\\n Histology, Hormone Receptor (HR) Status, HER2 Status, \\nIntrinsic Subtype\\n Ductal, Lobular, Mixed, Metaplastic Histology\\nER positive and/or PgR positive\\nHR-positive–HER2-positive disease treatment\\nHR-positive–HER2-negative disease treatment\\nER negative and PgR negative\\nHR-negative–HER2-positive disease treatment\\nHR-negative–HER2-negative disease treatment\\n Pure Tubular, Pure Mucinous Histology\\nER positive and/or PgR positive (if ER negative and PgR negative, repeat assess-\\nment of tumor ER/PgR status)\\n Intrinsic Subtype [21]\\nIntrinsic subtype\\nLuminal A Luminal A like\\nLuminal B Luminal B like (HER-2 negative)\\nLuminal B like (HER-2 positive)\\nc-ERB B2 overexpression HER2 positive (non-luminal)\\nBasal-like Triple negative\\n20 A.

The Ki-67 values differ between laboratories. Standardization \\nis recommended. Ki-67 is expected to correlate with the nuclear grade but may not directly corre-\\nlate with histological grade.

The Update Committee \\nof the American Society of Clinical Oncology and College of American Pathologists identified \\ncriteria and areas requiring clarification to improve the accuracy of HER2 testing by immunohisto-\\nchemistry (IHC) or in situ hybridization (ISH) [22]. The Committee recommended that HER2 sta-\\ntus (HER2 negative or positive) be determined in all patients with invasive (early-stage or recurrent) \\nbreast cancer based on one or more HER2 test results (negative, equivocal, or positive). Testing \\ncriteria define HER2-positive status if (upon observing an area of the tumor representing >10% \\ncontiguous and homogeneous tumor cells) there is evidence of protein overexpression (IHC) or \\ngene amplification (HER2 copy number or HER2/CEP17 ratio by ISH based on counting at least 20 \\ncells within the area). If the results are equivocal (revised criteria), reflex testing should be per-\\nformed using an alternative assay (IHC or ISH). Repeat testing should be considered if the results \\nappear to be discordant with other histopathological findings. Laboratories should demonstrate high \\nconcordance with a validated HER2 test on a sufficiently large and representative set of specimens. \\nTesting must be performed in a laboratory accredited by CAP or another accrediting entity [1, 3, 5, \\n6, 12]. bIn ASCO–CAP HER2 test guideline recommendations-2018 HER2 IHC scoring is reported \\nas follows [22]: Negative : Score 0: No staining observed or membrane staining that is incomplete, \\nfaint/barely perceptible and in ≤10% of invasive tumor cells. Score 1+: Incomplete membrane \\nstaining that is faint/barely perceptible and in >10% of invasive tumor cells. Equivocal (Score2+): \\nWeak/moderate complete membrane staining in >10% of invasive tumor cells or complete and cir-\\ncumferential membrane staining that is intense and in ≤10% of invasive tumor cells. Positive \\n(Score3+): Circumferential membrane staining in >10% of invasive tumor cells that is complete \\nand intense. Samples scored as 3+ are considered unequivocally positive, and those scoring 0/1+ are \\nconsidered negative. Equivocal scores (2+) mandate further assessment using ISH. Indeterminate: \\nThe test should be reported as indeterminate if technical issues prevent one or both tests (IHC and \\nISH) from being reported as positive, negative or equivocal. Examples include inadequate specimen \\nhandling, artifacts (e.g., crushed or marked edge artifacts) that make interpretation difficult, analyti-\\ncal testing failure or controls that are not as expected. The test should be repeated if possible. cIn \\nASCO–CAP HER2 test guideline recommendations-2018 HER2 ISH reporting is as follows [22]: \\nPositive: Single-probe average HER2 copy number ≥6.0 signals/cell. i,iiDual-probe HER2/CEP17 \\nratio ≥2.0 with an average HER2 copy number ≥4.0 signals per cell. Negative: Single-probe aver-\\nage HER2 copy number <4.0 signals/cell.

Aydiner et al.\\nUpdated findings of note include [22]:\\nRevision of the definition of IHC 2+ (equivocal) to the original FDA-approved \\ncriteria.\\nRepeat HER2 testing on a surgical specimen if the initially tested core biopsy is \\nnegative is no longer stated as mandatory. A new HER2 test may (no longer \\nshould) be ordered on the excision specimen on the basis of some criteria (such \\nas tumor grade 3).\\nA more rigorous interpretation criteria of the less common patterns that can be seen \\nin about 5% of all cases when HER2 status in breast cancer is evaluated using a \\ndual-probe ISH testing. These cases, described as ISH groups 2–4, should now \\nbe assessed using a diagnostic approach that includes a concomitant review of \\nthe IHC test, which will help the pathologist make a final determination of the \\ntumor specimen as HER2 positive or negative. The update on recommendations \\nfor HER2 testing with ISH method cancelled an equivocal result. Instead, forced \\npathologists to make a judgement as positive or negative using combination of \\nrepeated IHC and dual-probe ISH method. According to final update, if the \\nHER2/CEP 17 ratio ≥2.0 and average HER2 copy number is <4.0 the result \\nshould be negative after completion of a work-up. If the average HER2 copy \\nnumber is ≥6.0 and the ratio is <2.0 the result should be positive after completion \\nof a work-up.\\nThe Expert Panel also preferentially recommends the use of dual-probe instead of \\nsingle-probe ISH assays, but it recognizes that several single-probe ISH assays \\nhave regulatory approval in many parts of the world.\\n1 Decision Pathways in\\xa0Breast Cancer Management 23\\n Invasive Breast Cancer: Adjuvant Systemic Therapy\\n Luminal A\\xa0Like, Luminal B Like, HER-2 Positive, Triple \\nNegative (Table\\xa01.6)\\nTable 1.6 Recommendations for adjuvant treatment of breast cancer depending on intrinsic \\nsubtype and clinicopathological surrogate definitions [1, 3, 5, 6, 12, 21, 23–28]\\nIntrinsic Clinicopathological \\nsubtype definition Treatment Special considerationsb–f\\nLuminal A Luminal A like\\nER positive and PgR Endocrine Cytotoxics administered if high gene \\npositivea and therapy recurrence score (RS) (with \\nHER2-negative and Oncotype DX, RS\\xa0>\\xa025)d, grade 3 \\nKİ 67\\xa0≤\\xa0(14–19%)b disease, extensive lymphovascular \\nand invasion,c ≥4 lymph node metastasis, \\nRecurrence risk low young age (<35\\xa0years)f\\nwith multigene tests\\nLuminal B Luminal B like (HER2 negative)\\nER positive and Endocrine \\nHER2 negative and therapy for all, \\nKi67 ≥ (20–29%)b or, cytotoxics for \\nPgR low/negative or, most\\nRecurrence risk high \\nwith multigene tests\\nLuminal B like (HER2 positive)\\nHER2 overexpressed Cytotoxics and \\nor amplified antiHER-2 and \\nAny Ki-67 endocrine \\ntherapy\\nHER-2 HER2 positive (non-luminal)\\noverexpression\\nHER2 overexpressed Cytotoxics and \\nor amplified and antiHER-2 \\nER and PgR absent therapy\\nBasal-like Triple negative\\nER negative and PgR Cytotoxics 80% overlap between triple-negative \\nnegative and basal-like subtypes\\nHER2 negative\\naMore than 20% positivity [3, 5, 21]\\nbSt. Gallen 2015: The minimum value of Ki67 required for “Luminal B like” is 20–29%.

The chemotherapy \\nregimen for these patients may contain anthracyclines. If provided in stage I and if the tumor diameter is <1 to 2\\xa0cm, the combination of \\npaclitaxel and trastuzumab may be preferred regimen [32].

Trastuzumab or chemotherapy \\nis not recommended for microinvasive disease (invasive tumor ≤1\\xa0mm). dA meta-analysis consisting of eight studies has shown that the HER2-positive pheno-\\ntype is associated with a poorer outcome compared to HR-positive and HER2-negative groups in terms of disease-free survival (DFS; RR\\xa0=\\xa03.677, P\\xa0<\\xa00.001) \\nand distant disease-free survival (DDFS; RR\\xa0=\\xa03.824, P\\xa0<\\xa00.001) [33]. However, there was no significant difference in terms of clinical endpoints between \\nHER2-positive and triple-negative breast cancers. Moreover, the addition of trastuzumab in patients with pT1a-b N0M0 disease yielded a significant improve-\\nment in terms of DFS (RR\\xa0=\\xa00.323, P\\xa0<\\xa00.001). This meta-analysis showed that the intrinsic subtype may be a reliable marker for prognosis in patients with \\npT1a-bN0M0 breast cancer. Adjuvant trastuzumab may provide a significant survival benefit even in early-stage HER2-positive breast cancer patients [33]. eIn \\nan uncontrolled, single-group, multicenter study of adjuvant paclitaxel and trastuzumab, 406 patients with tumors measuring up to 3\\xa0cm in the greatest dimen-\\nsion were included [32]. Patients received weekly treatment with paclitaxel and trastuzumab for 12\\xa0weeks, followed by 9\\xa0months of trastuzumab monotherapy. \\nThe median follow-up period was 4.0\\xa0years. The 3-year rate of survival free from invasive disease was 98.7% (95% confidence interval [CI], 97.6–99.8). Among \\nwomen with predominantly stage I HER2-positive breast cancer, treatment with adjuvant paclitaxel plus trastuzumab was associated with a risk of early recur-\\nrence of approximately 2%; 6% of patients withdrew from the study due to protocol-specified adverse events. fFertility preservation (e.g., by ovarian tissue or \\noocyte conservation) should be offered to women <40\\xa0years of age.

Trastuzumab and pertuzumab are recommended in neoadjuvant therapy [1, 3]. The version 1.0 2018 NCCN \\nGuidelines recommend AC—paclitaxel and trastuzumab (± pertuzumab); TCH ± pertuzumab (pertuzumab given to patients with \\ngreater than or equal to T2 or greater than or equal to N1, HER2-positive early-stage breast cancer) [1, 24, 26]. The St Gallen panel did \\nnot support dual HER2 blockade with pertuzumab or lapatinib in the postoperative adjuvant treatment [3]. According to the APHINITY \\nstudy, which published the early results, adjuvant trastuzumab\\xa0 +\\xa0 pertuzumab treatment prolonged disease-free survival in HER2-\\npositive patients. This benefit was particularly evident in high-risk patients who were hormone receptor negative and node positive [24]. \\nAccording to a randomized controlled trial, 1-year neratinib use after 1-year administration of trastuzumab reduced the recurrence rate \\n[36]. This benefit was especially evident in ER-positive, Her-2-positive disease. However, diarrhea was an important adverse effect. The \\n1 Decision Pathways in\\xa0Breast Cancer Management 31\\nSt Gallen 2017 panel did not respond to the question regarding extended adjuvant neratinib administration [3]. However, after 1\\xa0year of \\ntrastuzumab administration in hormone receptor-positive patients, 1 year of neratinib can be used [26]. cIn high-risk premenopausal \\npatients, “LHRH-agonist\\xa0+\\xa0aromatase inhibitor” may be the preferred adjuvant endocrine therapy. In a randomized phase III study, a total \\nof 3066 premenopausal women were stratified according to whether they previously received chemotherapy to receive 5\\xa0years of tamoxi-\\nfen, tamoxifen plus ovarian suppression therapy, or exemestane plus ovarian suppression therapy [35]. After a median follow-up of \\n67\\xa0months, the estimated disease-free survival rate at 5\\xa0years was 86.6% in the tamoxifen-ovarian suppression group and 84.7% in the \\ntamoxifen group (hazard ratio for disease recurrence, second invasive cancer, or death, 0.83; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.66–1.04; \\nP\\xa0=\\xa00.10). At 5\\xa0years, the rate of freedom from breast cancer was 85.7% in the exemestane-o varian suppression group (hazard ratio for \\nrecurrence vs. tamoxifen, 0.65; 95% CI, 0.49–0.87) [35]. In high-risk postmenopausal patients, aromatase inhibitors may be preferred \\nover tamoxifen [3, 12, 21, 23, 25, 27, 28]. dChemotherapy and endocrine therapy as adjuvant therapy should be given sequentially, with \\nendocrine therapy following chemotherapy. The available data suggest that sequential or concurrent endocrine therapy with radiation \\ntherapy is acceptable [1, 3, 12]\\n32 A.

The choice of treatment depends on disease, co-morbidities, life expectancy and patient preferences. In patients over \\n70\\xa0years of age, treatment should be individualized [3, 12]. A meta-analysis showed that dose- intensive treatment increased overall survival in hormone \\nreceptor-negative and hormone receptor-p ositive patients (EBTCG, San Antonio, 2017). bThe following factors are indications for including ovarian \\n1 Decision Pathways in\\xa0Breast Cancer Management 33\\nfunction suppression (OFS): age ≤35\\xa0years, premenopausal estrogen level following adjuvant chemotherapy, grade 3 disease, involvement of 4 or more \\nnodes, and adverse multigene test results [3]. The ASCO Guideline recommends OFS in premenopausal patients with stage II and III disease who have \\nchemotherapy indications; however, this is not recommended for stage I disease [27]. The optimal OFS duration is 5\\xa0years. cIn high-risk premenopausal \\nwomen, ‘LHRH- agonist\\xa0+\\xa0aromatase inhibitor’ may be the preferred adjuvant endocrine therapy [27, 35]. The following factors are indications for the \\nuse of OFS plus an aromatase inhibitor (AI) rather than OFS plus tamoxifen: age ≤35\\xa0years, grade 3 disease, involvement of 4 or more nodes, and \\nadverse multigene test results [1, 3, 12, 27, 35]. dIn patients with Luminal A-like tumors and 1–3 positive lymph nodes (with the evaluation of other \\nfactors such as grade, age, or multigene signature test results), “adjuvant endocrine therapy alone” may be an option [3, 5, 6, 12]. eSome patients may \\nbe adequately treated with tamoxifen alone. In high-risk postmenopausal patients, AIs may be preferred over tamoxifen [1, 3, 12, 27, 35]. The following \\nfactors support the inclusion of an AI at some point: lymph node involvement, grade 3 disease, high Ki67 proliferation index, or HER2 positivity. If an \\nAI is used, it should be started upfront in patients at higher risk. The upfront AI can be switched to tamoxifen after 2\\xa0years in selected patients (e.g., \\nthose experiencing side effects of the AI) [1, 3, 12]. fAfter 5\\xa0years of adjuvant tamoxifen, continued AI (for postmenopausal estrogen levels at baseline \\nor postmenopausal patients with premenopausal estrogen levels at baseline) or tamoxifen (for premenopausal or postmenopausal patients) for up to \\n10\\xa0years should be recommended to patients with node-positive disease, grade 3 disease, or high Ki-67 [1, 3, 5, 6, 12]. gAfter 5\\xa0years of adjuvant therapy \\ninvolving a switch from tamoxifen to an AI (therefore assuming postmenopausal status at the 5-year time point and reasonable tolerance to endocrine \\ntherapy), patients may continue AI therapy for a cumulative total of 5\\xa0years [1, 3, 5, 6, 12]. hAfter 5\\xa0years of continuous AI adjuvant therapy, we do not \\n(yet) know whether to provide 3–5\\xa0years of tamoxifen, 3–5\\xa0years of AI, or no further endocrine treatment [1, 3, 37]. AI can be considered for an addi-\\ntional 5\\xa0years. However, a randomized clinical trial failed to show a difference in survival between 2 and 5\\xa0years’ use of additional AI (San Antonio \\nBCS, 2017). iThe optimal OFS duration is 5\\xa0years [1, 3, 6, 12]. jFactors that are relative indications for the inclusion of adjuvant cytotoxic chemotherapy \\ninclude the following: histological grade 3 tumor, 4 or more positive nodes, high Ki67, extensive lymphovascular invasion, and low hormone receptor \\nstaining [1, 3, 5, 6, 12]. kThe Luminal A phenotype is less responsive to chemotherapy. In node-negative disease, chemotherapy should not be added \\nbased on the T size. A combination of the biological properties of the tumor (such as Ki67, LVI, grade, and multigene signature) must be used to assess \\nwhether to provide chemotherapy [1, 3, 5, 6, 12, 25, 28]. Chemotherapy should be added in high-risk patients based on the involvement of 4 or more \\nlymph nodes (Table\\xa01.6). lBased on immunohistochemistry (IHC), in Luminal B-like (HER2-negative) tumors, chemotherapy may be omitted in some \\nlow-risk patients (based on combinations of certain prognostic factors such as low tumor mass, low grade, low Ki67, an absence of LVI, and older age) \\n[1, 3, 5, 6, 12, 25, 28]. mBased on multigene signature tests, chemotherapy may be omitted for patients with Luminal B-like (HER2-negative) disease \\nwith a low Oncotype Dx® score, MammaPrint® low-risk status, low PAM50 ROR score or EndoPredict® low-risk status [1, 3, 12, 25]. MammaPrint can \\nbe used in node-positive patients [31]. MammaPrint (Agendia, Irvine, CA): In patients with 1–3 positive lymph nodes, tests can be performed to avoid \\nadjuvant chemotherapy if the patient is at high clinical risk group in the MINDACT categorization (however, the patient should be informed that there \\nmay be an additional benefit of chemotherapy with multiple LN positivity). nFor Luminal B-like (HER2-negative) tumors, the regimen, if given, should \\ncontain anthracyclines and taxanes. A high-risk group might exist for which dose-dense therapy with G-CSF may also be preferred [1, 3, 38]. The effect \\nof dose-intensive treatment on disease recurrence has been investigated, and it has been shown that administration of 5-fluorouracil does not provide \\nadditional benefit [39, 40]\\n34 A.

The choice of treatment choice depends on disease, co-morbidities, life expectancy and patient preferences. In a meta-analysis, dose-\\nintensive treatment was shown to improve overall survival in hormone receptor-negative and hormone receptor-positive patients (EBTCG, San \\nAntonio BCS, 2017). For patients >70\\xa0years of age, treatment should be individualized [1, 3, 12]. bAC—paclitaxel and trastuzumab (± pertu-\\nzumab); TCH\\xa0±\\xa0pertuzumab (pertuzumab given to patients with greater than or equal to T2 or greater than or equal to N1, HER2-positive, \\nearly-stage breast cancer) can be recommended [24, 26, 41]. According to the early results of the APHINITY study, the authors concluded that \\npertuzumab can be considered as adjuvant therapy in HR-negative patients with node-positive or locally advanced tumors [24]. cIn patients with \\nHER2-positive, stage 2 disease, chemotherapy should always be provided to patients who require anti-HER2 therapy. The chemotherapy regi-\\nmen for these patients should preferably contain anthracyclines and taxanes. Anti-HER2 therapy should be initiated concurrently with taxane \\ntherapy. For tumors with a size of 1–2\\xa0cm or smaller, paclitaxel-trastuzumab can be used [3, 32, 33]. dConsider adjuvant bisphosphonate therapy \\nin postmenopausal (natural or induced) patients receiving adjuvant therapy\\n1 Decision Pathways in\\xa0Breast Cancer Management 35\\n HR-Negative and\\xa0HER2-Negative Disease (Fig.\\xa01.17)IBC: HR-NEGATIVE –HER2-NEGATIVE DISEASE (a-d)\\npT0-1-N1mi pT2-T3 and pN0-N1mi pT0-T3; and Node positive\\n(≤ 2 mm axillary (≤ 2 mm axillary node (presence of > 2 mm metastasis to 1\\nnode metastasis) metastasis)  or more ipsilateral axillary node)\\nTm ≤1.0 cm Tm = 1.1-2 cm \\nAdjuvant Adjuvant\\nchemotherapy chemotherapy\\n(proposal 1) (proposal 1)\\nAdjuvant\\nAdjuvant\\nchemotherapy\\nchemotherapy  \\n(proposal 1)   \\nFig. 1.17 Adjuvant systemic therapy for stage IB, II, IIIA—hormone receptor-negative and HER2-negative disease. aThere is no absolute age limit. \\nRather, treatment depends on the disease, the presence of comorbidities, the patient’s life expectancy, and patient preferences. For patients >70\\xa0years of \\nage, treatment should be individualized. Regardless of the size of the invasive tumor, adjuvant chemotherapy may be recommended in the presence of \\nN1mi. bFertility preservation (e.g., by ovarian tissue or oocyte conservation) should be offered to women <40\\xa0years of age. Ovarian function suppression \\nwith LHRHa during chemotherapy should be offered especially for receptor-negative disease [1, 3, 12, 21, 34]. cIn triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC), \\nthe regimen should include anthracyclines and taxanes. Although the data are insufficient, a platinum-based regimen may be considered only when a \\nBRCA mutation has been identified. Anthracyclines followed by taxanes represent an acceptable regimen for BRCA-mutant TNBC. Dose-dense chemo-\\ntherapy requiring growth factor support may also be an option. The preference of dose-intensive treatment in these patients was not recommended in St. \\nGallen (37% yes, 55% no) [3]. However, a meta-analysis showed that dose-intensive treatment improved overall survival in hormone receptor-negative \\nand hormone receptor-positive patients (EBTCG, San Antonio, 2017). Neoadjuvant treatment should be considered in triple-negative patients with stage \\nII and III disease. Treatment with platinum or alkylating agents may be considered in neoadjuvant chemotherapy (71% yes, 15% no) [3, 38]. Provision \\nof platinum-based treatment for all patients was voted as 10% ‘yes’ and 86% ‘no’ at St Gallen [3]. A platinum-based regimen may be recommended, \\nparticularly when a BRCA mutation is detected (voted as 47% ‘yes’ and 43% ‘no’ at St Gallen 2017) [3]. The administration of capecitabine after anthra-\\ncycline and taxane treatment reduces recurrence in patients with TNBC [42].

Its use for 5\\xa0years should be strongly recommended, especially in high-r isk patients [1, 3, 27]. cIn high-\\nrisk premenopausal patients, 5\\xa0years of “LHRH-agonist plus aromatase inhibitor (AI)” may be the preferred adjuvant endocrine therapy [35]. \\n(continued)\\n38 A. Aydiner et al.\\nFig. 1.19 (continued)\\nExemestane, letrozole or anastrozole can be used as an AI.\\xa0The following factors are indications for the use of OFS plus AI rather than OFS plus tamoxifen: \\nage ≤35\\xa0years, grade 3 disease, high Ki67, node positivity, lobular histology, HER-2 positivity, and adverse multigene test results [3, 35]. Serum estrogen, \\nfollicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) and luteinizing hormone (LH) levels should be measured in the evaluation of menopausal status for the use of an aromatase \\ninhibitor in premenopausal patients who have received chemotherapy. Estradiol levels should be checked at certain intervals. dAfter 5\\xa0years of continuous \\n“LHRH-agonist plus exemestane” adjuvant therapy, we do not (yet) know whether to provide further endocrine treatment [3, 35, 44]. eIn patients with Luminal \\nA-like tumors and 1–3 positive lymph nodes (with the evaluation of other factors such as grade, age or multigene signature test results), “adjuvant endocrine \\ntherapy alone” may be an option [3, 5, 6, 21, 25]. fAdjuvant endocrine therapy should be completed in 10\\xa0years in stage II and III patients, especially those with \\nmoderate to high recurrence risk, but is not recommended for stage I patients [1, 3, 23]. After 5\\xa0years of adjuvant tamoxifen, continued AI (for postmenopausal \\npatients with premenopausal estrogen levels at baseline) or tamoxifen for up to 10\\xa0years should be recommended to patients with node-positive disease, grade \\n3 disease, or high Ki-67. gAfter 5\\xa0years of adjuvant therapy involving a switch from tamoxifen to an AI (therefore assuming postmenopausal status at the 5-year \\ntime point and reasonable tolerance to endocrine therapy), patients may continue AI therapy for a cumulative total of 5\\xa0years. This subject requires clarification \\n[3]. There was no difference in survival between 2\\xa0years and 5\\xa0years of AI in a randomized clinical trial (San Antonio BCS, 2017). hBy immunohistochemistry \\n(IHC): In Luminal B-like (HER2-negative) tumors, chemotherapy may be omitted in some low-risk patients (based on combinations of certain prognostic fac-\\ntors such as low tumor mass, low grade, low Ki67, an absence of LVI, and older age) [3, 5, 6, 12, 21, 25, 28]. iBy multigene signature tests: Chemotherapy may \\nbe omitted for patients with Luminal B-like (HER2- negative) disease with a low Oncotype Dx® score, MammaPrint® low-risk status, low PAM50 ROR score, \\nor EndoPredict® low-risk status [1, 3, 12, 25, 28]. jConsider adjuvant bisphosphonate therapy in postmenopausal (natural or induced) patients receiving adjuvant \\ntherapy\\n1 Decision Pathways in\\xa0Breast Cancer Management 39\\n Postmenopausal at Diagnosis (Box 1.2) (Fig.\\xa01.20)\\nBox 1.2 The definition of menopause\\nMenopause can be defined as natural menopause (no menses for 12\\xa0months \\nbefore starting chemotherapy or hormone therapy) or as menopause with \\novarian ablation or suppression.

In high-risk postmenopausal patients, aromatase inhibitors (AIs) may be preferred over tamoxifen [3]. The follow-\\ning factors argue for the inclusion of an AI at some point: lymph node involvement, grade 3 disease, high Ki67 proliferation index, or HER2 positivity. If an AI \\nis used, it should be started upfront in patients at higher risk. The upfront AI can be switched to tamoxifen after 2\\xa0years in selected patients (e.g., those experi-\\nencing side effects of the AI) [3]. cAfter 5\\xa0years of adjuvant tamoxifen, continued AI or tamoxifen (for patients with intolerance to AI therapy) for up to 10 years \\nshould be recommended to patients with node-positive disease, grade 3 disease, or high Ki-67 [1, 3, 6, 12]. dAfter 5\\xa0years of adjuvant therapy involving a switch \\nfrom tamoxifen to an AI (therefore assuming postmenopausal status at the 5-year time point and reasonable tolerance to endocrine therapy), patients may con-\\n1 Decision Pathways in\\xa0Breast Cancer Management 41\\ntinue AI therapy for a cumulative total of 5\\xa0years. This subject requires clarification [3]. eAfter 5\\xa0years of continuous AI adjuvant therapy, extension of treatment \\nwith an aromatase inhibitor may be recommended for 3–5\\xa0years [1, 3, 23]. In a randomized study, no difference between the 2- and 5-year survival was observed \\n(San Antonio BCS, 2017). In patients with moderate to high risk, adjuvant endocrine treatment should be increased to 10\\xa0years (in patients with stage II and III \\ndisease); this increase is not recommended for stage I patients [1, 3, 12, 23, 37]. fBy multigene signature tests: chemotherapy may be omitted for patients with \\nLuminal B-like (HER2- negative) disease with a low Oncotype Dx® score, MammaPrint® low-risk status, low PAM50 ROR score, or EndoPredict® low-risk \\nstatus [1, 3, 12, 25]. gThe definition of menopause is important and can include natural menopause (no menses for 12\\xa0months before starting chemotherapy or \\nhormone therapy) or menopause with ovarian ablation or suppression.

According to the results of a clinical trial that \\nrandomized low-risk early-stage breast cancer patients, accelerated partial-breast RT was not inferior to standard whole-breast RT [46]. Partial-breast RT can \\nbe performed in ASTRO/ESTRO “eligible” low-risk patients, although there are insufficient data in the literature (at St Gallen 2017 [3]: 67% yes, 24% no) \\n[47]. Whole-breast RT should be performed in other patients. Boost therapy may not be performed in patients aged 60 years or older, patients with low-grade \\ntumors having favorable tumor biology and/or patients who will receive adjuvant endocrine therapy [48, 54]. Regional node irradiation (RNI) prolongs disease-\\nfree survival in high- risk patients, but the risk of toxicity increases and may lead to complications during reconstruction surgery [45, 55]. At St. Gallen 2017, \\nRNI was recommended in pN1 (1–3 positive lymph nodes) in the presence of unfavorable clinical features (40\\xa0years and younger, unfavorable tumor biology, \\nlow or negative estrogen-receptor status, high grade [grade 3], diffuse lymphovascular invasion, and positivity of more than 3 lymph nodes) [3]. According to \\nthe NCCN guidelines, axilla-negative patients should be evaluated for RNI for central/medial tumors or >2\\xa0cm tumors and the presence of other risk factors \\n(young age or extensive lymphovascular invasion) [1]. cBane et\\xa0al. attempted to assess whether tumor grade, molecular subtype and hypoxia status could predict \\nthe response to hypofractionated versus standard RT following BCS for node-negative breast cancer in a randomized controlled trial (RCT) [49]. Review and \\ntumor grade assessment using the Nottingham grading system was conducted. Tumors were classified by molecular subtype as Luminal A, Luminal B, HER2 \\nenriched, basal like, or unclassified using a six-biomarker panel: ER, PgR, HER-2, Ki67, CK5/6, and EGFR.\\xa0The median follow-up was 12\\xa0years. In the mul-\\ntivariable Cox model, molecular subtype was the only predictive factor for local recurrence; the 10-year cumulative incidence was 4.5% for Luminal A and \\nbasal-like, 7.9% for Luminal B, and 16.9% for HER2-enriched tumors (p\\xa0<\\xa00.01) [49]. dStudies are underway to evaluate the radiotherapy decision in patients \\nwith complete response after neoadjuvant chemotherapy. Patients must be evaluated individually. The decision for radiotherapy is determined according to the \\ndisease stage before neoadjuvant chemotherapy, but the disease stage may also be important for management after treatment. When the NSABP B-51 and \\nAlliance A11202 studies are completed, they will provide information about the sufficiency of axillary staging and RT application after neoadjuvant \\nchemotherapy\\n1 Decision Pathways in\\xa0Breast Cancer Management 45\\n Invasive Breast Cancer: Adjuvant Radiotherapy After \\nMastectomy\\n Pathologic Stage I, II, IIIA, IIIB, IIIC (Fig.\\xa01.23)\\nSTAGE I, IIA, IIB, IIIA, IIIB, IIIC \\nMastectomy + axillary staging (proposal 1) ± reconstruction \\nAdjuvant radiation treatment following mastectomy (a,b)\\n≥ 4 positive axillary\\nnodes 1-3 positive axillary nodes Negative axillary nodes\\nTumor > 5 cm or Tumor ≤ 5 cm and\\nPostchemotherapy Tumor ≤ 5 cm and \\nDefinitively evaluate for border positive border ≥ 1 mm\\nRT to the chest wall close border (< 1 mm)\\npostchemotherapy RT to the\\n(proposal 1) + RT to chest wall + infra-and supra-\\nthe infra-and supra- clavicular regions    \\nclavicular regions Evaluate for RT to Evaluate for\\nthe chest wall ± postchemotherapy No need for \\ninfra-and supra- RT to the chest wall RT\\nclavicular nodes\\nDefinitively Definitively \\nevaluate for RT to evaluate for RT to \\ne internal the internal \\nDefinitively \\nth\\nte for RT to \\nmammary nodes mammary nodes if \\nevalua\\nRT is to be the internal \\nadministered mammary nodes \\nFig. 1.23 Adjuvant radiotherapy after mastectomy [45–55]. aRT following chemotherapy if chemotherapy is indicated. bPost-mastec-\\ntomy RT is standard for patients who meet the following criteria: T size ≥5\\xa0cm (node negative); 1–3 nodes with adverse pathology [this \\nis not the sole criterion in patients of young age (<40)]; 4 or more positive axillary LNs; and positive sentinel lymph node biopsy with \\nno axillary dissection [1, 3].

The St Gallen 2017 Consensus Panel supported dual anti-HER2 therapy as an acceptable regimen with neoad-\\njuvant taxane, trastuzumab and pertuzumab in such patients and considered anthracycline-taxane and anti-HER2 treatments as the best options [3]. \\n“Trastuzumab\\xa0+\\xa0pertuzumab” was recommended as anti-HER2 treatment in neoadjuvant therapy for stage II and III patients in the St Gallen 2017 \\nconsensus meeting [1, 3, 26]. In these patients, while the NCCN and ASCO guidelines considered double inhibition in postoperative adjuvant therapy \\nfeasible, the St Gallen consensus has indicated that there is no sufficient evidence yet. bStage II–III triple-negative disease: If provided to patients with \\ntriple-negative tumors, the preferred regimen should include an anthracycline and a taxane [1, 3]. cNeoadjuvant cytotoxic therapy should be discussed \\nas an option and provided frequently to patients with “Luminal A-like” tumors, only if conservative surgery would not otherwise be feasible [3]. dNeo-\\n1 Decision Pathways in\\xa0Breast Cancer Management 53\\nadjuvant endocrine therapy without cytotoxics represents a reasonable option for some selected postmenopausal patients with endocrine-responsive \\ndisease. The duration of treatment must be at least 4\\xa0months, and treatment can be provided until a maximal response is reached [3]. eIn triple-negative \\nbreast cancer (TNBC), the regimen should contain anthracyclines and taxanes. Although the available data are insufficient, a platinum-based regimen \\nmay be considered only in patients with a known BRCA mutation. Anthracyclines followed by taxanes is an acceptable regimen for BRCA-mutant \\nTNBC.\\xa0Dose-dense chemotherapy requiring growth factor support may also be an option [3]. fSentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) is appropriate for \\npatients who are clinically node positive on admission, respond well to chemotherapy and become clinically axillary negative. gEvaluation with MR \\nimaging is recommended for patients who will undergo BCS after neoadjuvant therapy. After neoadjuvant chemotherapy, complete excision of the \\nentire primary tumor area is not necessary (if there is shrinkage in the tumor). Clinical examination and radiological imaging modalities (USG, MMG, \\nMR imaging) are used to evaluate the tissue to be excised (shrinking or patching). However, if the tumor response is patchy, the original tumor area \\nshould be removed with clean surgical margins [1, 3, 56]. If diffuse live tumor cells are observed in the excised lumpectomy specimen after neoadjuvant \\nchemotherapy, re-excision should be performed even if there is no surgical margin involvement.

If SLN is positive, axillary lymph node dissec-\\ntion must be performed. After downstaging, resection of the entire area of the original primary tumor is not necessary (if there is shrinkage in the \\ntumor).

In a randomized clinical trial, \\nadjuvant capecitabine has been shown to be beneficial in triple-negative patients [43]. However, there is no other study confirming this suggestion. \\ndHER2-targeted therapy: When indicated, trastuzumab can be administered with RT and together with endocrine therapy. According to the version \\n1.0 2018 NCCN and ASCO Guidelines, “pertuzumab\\xa0+\\xa0trastuzumab” should be used as anti-HER2 treatment in neoadjuvant treatment, and pertu-\\nzumab can be continued in adjuvant treatment in ≥T2 and ≥N1 HER2-positive patients [1, 26]. In the St. Gallen 2017 guidelines, since there is no \\nevidence, only 6% of panelists accepted (69% voted ‘no’) the use of both trastuzumab and pertuzumab as postoperative adjuvant treatment in patients \\nwho had received neoadjuvant trastuzumab-pertuzumab treatment [3]. However, pertuzumab use in adjuvant therapy can be considered in node-\\npositive, HR-negative patients according to APHINITY study results [24]. According to a randomized controlled trial, 1-year neratinib use after \\n1-year administration of trastuzumab reduced the recurrence rate [36]. This benefit was obvious especially in ER-positive, HER-2-positive disease. \\nHowever, diarrhea is an important side effect [1, 3, 26].

Furthermore, 49% of \\n1 Decision Pathways in\\xa0Breast Cancer Management 57\\nthe panelists recommended capecitabine, 7% recommended platinum, 9% recommended BRCA-positive platinum, and 4% recommended metronomic \\ntreatment [3, 43].

In a randomized clinical trial, adjuvant capecitabine was shown to be beneficial in triple-negative patients [43]. However, there is no \\nother study confirming this suggestion. dHER2-targeted therapy: When indicated, trastuzumab can be administered with RT and together with endocrine \\ntherapy. “Pertuzumab\\xa0+\\xa0trastuzumab” should be used as anti-HER2 treatment in neoadjuvant treatment, and pertuzumab can be continued in adjuvant \\ntreatment in ≥T2 and ≥N1 HER2-positive patients [1, 26]. In the St. Gallen 2017 guidelines, since there is no evidence, only 6% of panelists accepted \\n(69% voted ‘no’) the use of both trastuzumab and pertuzumab as postoperative adjuvant treatment in patients who had received neoadjuvant trastuzumab-\\npertuzumab treatment [3]. However, pertuzumab use in adjuvant therapy can be considered in node-positive, HR-negative patients according to APHINITY \\nstudy results [24]. According to the results of a randomized study, 1-year administration of trastuzumab after neratinib use for 1\\xa0year reduced the recur-\\nrence rate [36]. This benefit was obvious, especially in ER-positive, HER-2-positive disease. However, diarrhea is an important side effect [1, 3, 26]. \\nDespite the recommendations of NCCN and ASCO, no decision was made in the St Gallen consensus about neratinib use\\n58 A.

This benefit was obvious especially in ER-positive, HER-2-positive disease. However, diarrhea is an important side effect [1, 3, 26]. The rate of pCR \\nis lower when neoadjuvant ado-trastuzumab emtansine (TDM-1) is given with pertuzumab than for chemotherapy-t rastuzumab- pertuzumab (TCHP) treatment \\n[3]. Adaptive therapy with the dual tyrosine kinase inhibitor neratinib increases the rate of pCR compared to trastuzumab-based therapy, but this needs to be \\nconfirmed [36]. bFor triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC), the regimen should contain anthracyclines and taxanes. The addition of carboplatin to the treatment \\nincreases the rate of pathologic complete response (pCR), which prolongs disease-free survival [38]. Although the available data are insufficient, a platinum-\\nbased regimen may be considered only in patients with a known BRCA mutation. Anthracyclines followed by taxanes is an acceptable regimen for BRCA-\\nmutant TNBC.\\xa0 In an adaptive study, the addition of veliparib and carboplatin to the treatment increased the rate of pCR [61]. Dose-dense chemotherapy \\nrequiring growth factor support may also be an option [1]. cData regarding the use of nab-paclitaxel instead of paclitaxel in neoadjuvant chemotherapy, or \\nmetronomic therapy are inconsistent [62, 63]. dNeoadjuvant endocrine therapy shows high response rates in patients with low genomic scores [3]. The addition \\nof cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) 4/6 inhibitors to aromatase inhibitors significantly decreases tumor cell proliferation rates [64, 65]. eConsider adjuvant \\nbisphosphonate therapy in postmenopausal (natural or induced) patients receiving adjuvant therapy [58–60]\\n1 Decision Pathways in\\xa0Breast Cancer Management 61\\n Adjuvant Therapy After Surgical Treatment (Fig.\\xa01.33)IBC: CLINICAL STAGE IIIA (N2M0)–IIIB AND IIIC \\nSurgery after preoperative chemotherapy\\nAdjuvant systemic therapy after surgery(a-c) Adjuvant RT after surgery\\nContinue chemotherapy if not completed preoperatively\\n(proposal 1) Postmastectomy adjuvant RT should be provided\\naccording to prechemotherapy tumor characteristics:\\nRT to infraclavicular and supraclavicular nodes and\\nIf  ER positive and/or PR positive, endocrine therapy chest wall (if additional involvement, RT to internal\\n(proposal 1) mammary gland; if no clinical involvement, definitely\\nevaluate for RT to internal mammary gland)\\nIf  HER2 positive, complete anti-HER2 therapy (proposal 1)\\nPostlumpectomy adjuvant RT should be provided\\naccording to prechemotherapy tumor characteristics:\\nRT to infraclavicular and supraclavicular nodes and\\nFor patients with triple-negative tumors, evaluate for additional breast (if additional involvement, RT to internal\\nchemotherapy (if standard chemotherapy completed mammary gland)\\npreoperatively)\\nFig. 1.33  Adjuvant treatment approach after neoadjuvant systemic treatment and surgery for patients with clinical stage IIIA (N2M0)—IIIB \\nand IIIC breast cancer. aHER2-targeted therapy: When indicated, anti-HER2 therapy can be administered with RT and together with endocrine \\ntherapy. “Pertuzumab\\xa0+\\xa0trastuzumab” should be used as anti-HER2 treatment in neoadjuvant treatment, and pertuzumab can be continued in \\nadjuvant treatment in ≥T2 and ≥N1 HER2-positive patients [1, 26].

If an inadequate response to chemotherapy is considered at postoperative pathological examina-\\ntion, additional adjuvant chemotherapy can be considered (e.g., treatment including capecitabine or platinum in TNBC) despite completion of preoperative \\nchemotherapy [43]. Clinical trials of post-neoadjuvant therapy are ongoing, namely, CDK 4/6 inhibitors, poly ADP ribose polymerase (PARP) inhibitors, plati-\\nnums, ado-trastuzumab emtansine, and immunotherapeutic agents. The addition of cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) 4/6 inhibitors to aromatase inhibitors sig-\\nnificantly decreases tumor cell proliferation rates [3, 64, 65]. cConsider adjuvant bisphosphonate therapy in postmenopausal (natural or induced) patients \\nreceiving adjuvant therapy [58–60]\\n1 Decision Pathways in\\xa0Breast Cancer Management 63\\n Invasive Breast Cancer: Post-Therapy Follow-Up (Table\\xa01.7)\\nTable 1.7 Post-therapy follow-up of patientsa [1, 3, 12]\\n–History and physical examination every 3–6\\xa0months in the first 3\\xa0years, every 6\\xa0months in the \\nfollowing 2\\xa0years, and then at 12-month intervals.\\n–Annual mammography (mammography can be performed in the sixth month in those \\nundergoing RT after BCS).\\n–Women receiving tamoxifen: if the uterus is present, annual gynecological examination.\\n– Women receiving an aromatase inhibitor or developing treatment-induced ovarian failure \\nshould be monitored for bone health by bone mineral density measurements at baseline and \\nperiodically thereafter.\\n–Evaluate and encourage compliance with adjuvant endocrine therapy.\\n–Evidence suggests that maintaining an active lifestyle and reaching and maintaining an ideal \\nbody mass index (BMI 20–25) lead to optimal breast cancer outcomes.

There are no data on its use in local recurrence after complete local \\nresection.\\n 1. Zoledronic acid and clodronate are recommended in breast cancer.

The benefit of palliative local breast surgery to women presenting with stage IV disease remains unclear. This \\nlocal therapy should be considered only after a response to initial systemic therapy. Notably, some studies suggest that surgery is only valuable \\nif performed with the same attention to detail (e.g., attaining clear margins and addressing disease in the axilla) as in patients with early-stage \\ndisease. If bone disease is present, add denosumab, zoledronic acid, ibandronic acid, or pamidronate. b“Anti-programmed death-1” \\n(PD-1)/”Programmed death ligand” (PDL-1) antibodies were found to be effective alone or with taxanes in patients with triple-negative tumors \\n[72]. cThe addition of CDK4/6 inhibitors to the first- or second-choice endocrine treatment was found to be effective in randomized clinical trials \\n[73, 74] (Table\\xa01.8). dAnti-HER2 therapy must be added to HER2-positive patients.

According to the PERTAIN trial, addition of pertuzumab to trastuzumab and endocrine treatment in the first choice prolonged \\nprogression-free survival. The addition of pertuzumab in the second line in patients who did not receive pertuzumab in the first line provided a \\nminor clinical benefit [68]. eRetrospective studies suggest a potential survival benefit from complete excision of the primary tumor in select \\npatients with metastatic breast cancer. Substantial selection biases exist in all of these studies and are likely to confound the study results. Two \\nrecent prospective, randomized studies assessed whether or not surgery on the primary tumor in the breast is necessary for women who are diag-\\nnosed with metastatic breast cancer. The results from both studies were similar and showed that surgical treatment of primary tumors in woman \\npresenting with stage IV disease does not produce an increase in OS in general [76, 77]. However, a survival advantage for primary tumor exci-\\nsion was observed only in patients with solitary bone metastasis in the Turkish study [77]\\n1 Decision Pathways in\\xa0Breast Cancer Management 73\\n Invasive Breast Cancer: Recurrent or Stage IV Disease: \\nSystemic Treatment\\n HR-Positive; HER2-Positive or HER2-Negative (Table\\xa01.8) \\n(Fig.\\xa01.41)\\nTable 1.8 Endocrine therapy in hormone receptor positive HER2-negative advanced breast cancer\\nOvarian suppression (GnRH agonist) or ablation to all premenopausal patients\\nEndocrine treatment naïve Previous endocrine treatment\\nNo contraindication Contraindication Under endocrine treatment Disease recurrence at \\nto CDK inhibitors to CDK inhibitors or within 12\\xa0months after least one year after the \\nthe end of adjuvant end of adjuvant \\nendocrine treatment endocrine treatment\\nCDK inhibitora and Fulvestrant CDK inhibitor and Treat as patients who \\naromatase inhibitors fulvestrant are endocrine \\ntreatment naïve\\nCDK inhibitorb and Aromatase CDK inhibitor and \\nFulvestrant inhibitors aromatase inhibitors\\nFulvestrant Tamoxifen Everolimus and exemestane \\nOR tamoxifen OR \\nfulvestrant\\nAbemeciclib and tamoxifen \\nif not used previously\\nAbemaciclib\\nFulvestrant if not used \\npreviously\\nIf an aromatase inhibitor \\nused previously, switch to \\nother (steroidal to \\nnonsteroidal or vice versa)\\nTamoxifen\\nProgestins\\nEstrogens or androgens\\naPablociclib, ribociclib, abemaciclib\\nbRibociclib\\n74 A.

The World Health Organization (WHO) established the name phyllodes tumor and \\nthe following histological types: benign, borderline, and malignant. Breast imaging studies may \\nfail to distinguish a phyllodes tumor from a fibroadenoma. A core needle biopsy is preferable to \\nfine-needle aspiration for tissue diagnosis. The common treatment for phyllodes tumors is wide \\nlocal excision. Mastectomy is indicated for patients with a large lesion. The benefits of adjuvant \\nchemotherapy and radiotherapy are controversial. bBorderline malignant phyllodes tumors should \\nbe treated with large surgical excision with a clean surgical margin of 1\\xa0cm or more. The width of \\nthe surgical margin for benign phyllodes tumors is controversial, and a negative surgical margin is \\nsufficient [85, 86]\\n84 A.

Paget’s disease of the breast is characterized by eczema-form changes accompa-\\nnied by erosion and ulceration of the nipple and areolar epidermis. This condition is primarily \\ncorrelated with ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS); additionally, it can be accompanied by invasive \\nductal carcinoma (IDC). The diagnosis is determined upon microscopic observation of Paget cells \\nin a skin biopsy. The width of the lesion is evaluated via mammography and MRI in patients for \\nwhom breast-conserving surgery is planned.

Aydiner et al.\\nBreast Cancer During Pregnancy. aPregnancy should be terminated in patients who become \\npregnant during tamoxifen treatment. The risk of malformation is high in the first trimester for \\ntamoxifen use. Adjuvant trastuzumab is not recommended in pregnancy. However, the pregnancy \\ncan be continued by informing the patient because there are no sufficient data regarding the risk of \\nmalformation in women who become pregnant under trastuzumab treatment. Trastuzumab should \\nbe discontinued [1, 3, 5, 88]. bPremature delivery should be avoided. In patients receiving chemo-\\ntherapy, the last chemotherapy cycle should not be given for a period of 1\\xa0month prior to the esti-\\nmated date of birth (due to the risk of neutropenia in the baby). BCS can be performed in pregnancy, \\nbut the patient should be informed about the risk of local recurrence since RT will be performed \\nafter delivery (if RT cannot be started within 6\\xa0months after surgical operation). Blue dye is not \\nused as the SLNB method. The radionuclide method in SLNB can be used as of the second trimes-\\nter. Adjuvant RT, endocrine therapy and trastuzumab are administered after delivery when adju-\\nvant therapy is indicated. Doxorubicin, 5-fluorouracil, and cyclophosphamide (FAC) can be used \\nas chemotherapy (or AC). Ondansetron is preferred for nausea. Currently, there are no data encour-\\naging safe administration of dose-dense AC with or without taxanes. A systematic review regard-\\ning taxane administration during pregnancy identified twenty-three publications describing a total \\nof 40 women [89]. There were no spontaneous abortions or intrauterine deaths reported. In two \\ncases exposed to paclitaxel, acute respiratory distress possibly was related to prematurity [90, 91]. \\nThe only malformation possibly related to taxanes was a case of pyloric stenosis in a neonate \\nwhom mother had received multiagent chemotherapy (doxorubicin, cyclophosphamide, pacli-\\ntaxel, and docetaxel). Although there are no sufficient data yet, weekly paclitaxel can be given \\nafter the first trimester if there is a clinical indication (e.g., progression under neoadjuvant treat-\\nment with anthracycline). Since the safety of taxanes is less well documented than is that of \\nanthracyclines, in some situations an additional cycle of anthracycline-based chemotherapy during \\npregnancy and completion of taxane-based chemotherapy after delivery can be considered [92]. \\nAccording to the limited published data, the major cause of undesirable fetal outcome appears to \\nbe derived from premature delivery rather than from any direct effect of the chemotherapy. \\nFollow-up of children with specialized assessment including detailed physiological and neurologi-\\ncal  functions is necessary. The timing for permitting pregnancy in women with breast cancer is a \\nmatter of research\\n1 Decision Pathways in\\xa0Breast Cancer Management 87\\n \\n1st trimester Adjuvant chemotherapy beginning\\n(First 14 weeks), Mastectomy and axillary in the second trimester (after 14\\ndiscuss staging weeks).

If con-\\ntinued, the doses are modified.\\n Assessment of\\xa0the\\xa0Response to\\xa0Treatment in\\xa0Metastatic Disease\\nThe response should be determined in treated patients. Here, tumor markers and \\nradiological evaluations are used as objective parameters. The patient’s clinical sta-\\ntus, tumor markers and radiological evaluation provide more accurate results when \\nthey are considered together.\\n1 Decision Pathways in\\xa0Breast Cancer Management 89\\n Sensitivity and\\xa0Specificity in\\xa0Clinical Tests\\nDiagnostic and follow-up methods are compared according to their sensitivity and \\nspecificity.\\nThe following terminology is used:\\n 1. True positive: The disease is present in the patient, and the test is positive.\\n 2. False positive: The patient has no disease, but the test is positive.\\n 3. True negative: There is no specified disease in the patient, and the test is \\nnegative.\\n 4. False negative: The patient has the disease, but the test is negative.\\nSensitivity\\xa0=\\xa0true positives/(true positives\\xa0+\\xa0false negatives)\\n75% Sensitivity\\xa0=\\xa075% of those with the disease are diagnosed with the test (true \\npositive), but 25% of the patients cannot be recognized (false negative)\\nSpecificity\\xa0=\\xa0true negatives/(true negatives\\xa0+\\xa0false positives)\\n75% specificity: The test finds 75% of the people without the disease (true \\nnegatives), but 25% of those without the disorder are found to be ill (false \\npositives).\\nA first diagnostic method in cancer may have high sensitivity and low specific-\\nity. In this case, it can be concluded that many patients with false-positive results \\nwould be specified as disease-free by the second diagnostic method to be per-\\nformed. Although it is not realistic to develop a 100% accurate diagnostic tool, it is \\npossible to achieve the best diagnosis by using a first diagnostic method with high \\nsensitivity- low specificity and a second method with low sensitivity-high \\nspecificity.\\nPositive predictive value (PPV)\\xa0=\\xa0True positives/(True positives\\xa0+\\xa0False Positives)\\nThis expresses the ‘probability that a person with a positive test result is really \\nill’.\\nNegative predictive value (NPV)\\xa0 =\\xa0 True negatives/(True negatives\\xa0 +\\xa0 False \\nnegatives)\\nThis expresses the ‘probability that a person with a negative test result is really \\ndisease-free’.\\n Radiological Findings\\nThe most commonly used method in the response evaluation is RECIST (Response \\nEvaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors). The patient is defined as “responsive” if the \\ntumor regresses, “stable” if the tumor remains the same, and “progressive” if it \\nworsens. The PET response criteria have been published as PERCIST (PET \\nResponse Criteria in Solid Tumors).\\nIn RECIST, lesions are divided into four subgroups:\\nMeasurable lesions: The tumor is ≥10\\xa0mm on CT or MR imaging, and the lymph \\nnode is ≥15\\xa0mm or ≥20\\xa0mm on chest X-ray.\\n90 A. Aydiner et al.\\nNon-measurable lesions: Lesions smaller than those mentioned above or not \\nsuitable for direct measurement (such as sclerotic bone metastases, leptomeningeal \\ndisease, ascites, pleural/pericardial effusion)\\nTarget lesions: They are measurable lesions used in the response evaluation.\\nNon-target lesions: Assessment of non-measurable tumors or findings\\nSummary of response evaluation according to RECIST 1.1\\nThe smallest possible target ≥10\\xa0mm (CT\\xa0+\\xa0MRG)\\nlesion size ≥15\\xa0mm lymph nodes\\n≥20\\xa0mm chest X-ray\\nNumber of lesions measured Maximum of 5, maximum of 2 per organ\\nProgressive disease according 20% increase in total diameter (TD)\\xa0+\\xa0a net increase of at least \\nto measurable lesion 5\\xa0mm from the initial measurement of the tumor\\nProgressive disease according Progression if there is significant worsening or if the tumor \\nto non-target lesion burden has increased\\nPET-CT Can be used to confirm progression\\nThe following rules are applied for use of RECIST:\\n 1. The longest diameter of the tumor is measured.\\n 2. The non-tumor area is not included in the measurements.\\n 3. There is no obligation to select the largest tumors in the measurement. Tumors \\nthat are best identifiable and that can be evaluated in the measurements in \\nrepeated examinations are selected.\\n 4. Ensure that the imaging quality is good.\\n 5. Radiological examinations with intravenous contrast provide the most accurate \\nresults among imaging modalities. This is especially important in clinical study \\nparticipants (however, patients without adequate kidney function may require \\nunenhanced CT).\\n 6. The same tumors should be measured in all repeated evaluations to improve the \\nreliability of comparisons.\\n 7. In the measurement, large tumors with high measurement reliability are used.\\n 8. Mild growth in non-target tumors other than the measured target tumors is not \\nevidence of progression alone.\\n 9. If the measured target lesions become discrete lesions, the longest diameter of \\neach lesion is measured separately, and the sum is calculated to determine the \\ntotal diameter (TD).\\n 10. When the target lesions unite, the largest diameter of the final lesion is \\nmeasured.\\n 11. The hypervascular border area around the lesion is also measured (for example, \\nin the brain tumor, the contrast agent appears as a bright ring around the tumor, \\nand this area should be included in the measurement). The largest diameter is \\nmeasured without taking the central necrosis into account.\\n 12. The largest diameter is measured even if cavities and necrosis occur at the cen-\\nter of the target lesion. However, if the sum of the diameters is not compatible \\nwith the patient’s clinical response, another assessment method may be required.\\n1 Decision Pathways in\\xa0Breast Cancer Management 91\\n Special Rules for\\xa0Radiological Evaluation\\nLymph Nodes The longest diameter of the lymph node or nodal ligature is deter-\\nmined (e.g., 20\\xa0mm); then the longest short axis perpendicular to this line is mea-\\nsured (e.g., 13\\xa0 mm). A lymph node with a short axis of 13\\xa0 mm is considered \\npathological (>10\\xa0mm) but is not measurable (non-target). The diameter should be \\n≥15\\xa0mm for a measurable (target) lesion.\\nLytic Bone Lesions The visible soft tissue component can be assessed by CT or \\nMRI when present. The soft tissue component may be a “target” lesion if it is com-\\npatible with the measurable lesion rules. Blastic bone lesions are non-measurable \\nlesions (non-target).\\nMRI This provides very good contrast, and good measurements can be achieved \\nusing different techniques. However, the MRI quality is very important. MRI is not \\nused to measure lesions in the lung parenchyma. The measurement can be sagittal \\nor coronal (oblique). The measurements should always be made in the same plane.\\nPET-CT In some cases, PET-CT may be required to determine progression.\\nPatients who initially had a negative PET-CT result: If the new PET-CT is posi-\\ntive, it is considered progression due to presence of the new lesion.\\nPatients not initially evaluated with PET-CT:\\n– In a positive PET result, ‘progression’ is perceived if the CT finding is in a new, \\npreviously unidentified location.\\n– If the finding in the positive PET is not identified as a new lesion in CT, the new \\nlesion must be verified with CTs performed at specific time intervals to be con-\\nsidered ‘progression’.\\n– It is not accepted as progression if the positive PET lesion is present in previous \\nCTs and there is no anatomical growth.\\nReferences\\n 1.

This classification system was introduced to reflect \\nthe risk of recurrence and for use as a standard prognostic assessment tool for \\npatients with newly diagnosed breast cancer. The improved understanding of \\nprognostic and predictive biological markers, such as estrogen receptor (ER) \\nand HER2 overexpression, has been used to predict the response to systemic \\ntherapies (antiestrogen, anti-HER2) [3, 4]. Therefore, rapid advances in both \\nclinical and laboratory sciences along with translational research have raised \\nquestions about the feasibility of using the TNM staging as a guide to determine \\nwhether to apply systemic therapy based on anatomic prognosis. A recently \\nreported validation study has emphasized that the prognostic stage provides \\nmore accurate prognostic information than does the anatomic stage alone, thus \\nN.

Furthermore, \\nbreast cancer therapy has evolved with the increasing application of neoadju-\\nvant therapy, so additional pretreatment and post-treatment staging have been \\nincorporated into the TNM staging system to determine chemotherapy response \\nand treatment efficacy.\\n Changes in\\xa0Breast Cancer Staging\\nDue to advances in personalized medicine, the last update of AJCC Breast \\nCancer Staging incorporated more molecular gene assays and new prognostic \\nand predictive markers [6–9]. Lobular carcinoma in situ was removed from \\nTNM staging. An anatomic stage table, clinical prognostic stage table and path-\\nological prognostic stage table were added in the 8th edition. The pathological \\nstage table is based on clinical information, biomarker data, and findings from \\nsurgery and resected tissue. The largest contiguous tumor or tumor deposit is \\nused for pT and pN; for the primary tumor, the sizes of multiple tumors or \\nlymph node-adjacent satellite tumors are not added. The last edition clarified the \\npost neoadjuvant therapy pathological T category (ypT), which is based on the \\nlargest contiguous focus of residual invasive cancer, if present. When multiple \\nfoci of a residual tumor are present, the (m) modifier is included. Although \\nmulti-gene expression assays may provide additional prognostic and predictive \\ninformation beyond anatomic TNM staging and ER/PR and HER2 status, incor-\\nporating these biomarkers into the TNM system may be difficult. In the AJCC \\n8th edition, for patients with T1 and T2 hormone receptor-p ositive, HER-2 neg-\\native, and lymph node-negative tumors, a multigene panel is included in patho-\\nlogical prognostic staging. In the low-risk range, these tumors are placed in the \\nsame prognostic group category as T1a-T1bN0M0 regardless of T size (Tables \\n2.1, 2.2, 2.3, and 2.4).\\n Prognostic Breast Cancer Staging\\n Tumor Size\\nTumor size should ideally be measured before fixation and should be checked \\nwith microscopic size. Many studies have shown that patients with smaller \\ntumors have better long-term survival than do those with larger tumors [10–13]. \\nTumor size is based on the size of the invasive component of the tumor [14, 15]. \\nIn cases with an accompanying in situ component, the in situ area that is outside \\nthe invasive tumor is not included in the tumor size ‘T’. However, if the in situ \\n2 Breast Cancer Staging 101\\nTable 2.1 TNM primary tumor definitions\\nT: TNM primary tumor definitionsa\\nTx: Primary tumor cannot be assessed\\nT0: No evidence of primary tumor\\nTis: Carcinoma in situ\\n  • Tis (DCIS)b: Ductal carcinoma in situ\\n  • Tis (LCIS): Lobular carcinoma in situ (LCIS is treated as a benign entity and was \\nremoved from TNM staging in the AJCC 8th edition)\\n  •  Tis (Paget): Paget’s disease of the nipple (without an invasive carcinoma and/or \\ncarcinoma in situ (DCIS) in the underlying parenchyma)\\nT1: T <2\\xa0cm\\n  • T1mi: ≤0.1\\xa0cm (microinvasive tumor)\\n  •  Tla: > 0.1\\xa0cm, <0.5\\xa0cm (AJCC 8th edition: round any measurement >1.0–1.9\\xa0mm to \\n2\\xa0mm)\\n  • Tlb: >0.5\\xa0cm, ≤1\\xa0cm\\n  • Tlc: >1\\xa0cm, ≤2\\xa0cm\\nT2: >2\\xa0cm, ≤5\\xa0cm\\nT3: T\\xa0>\\xa05\\xa0cm\\nT4: Regardless of the size of the tumor: (a) involvement of the thoracic wall: ribs, intercostal \\nmuscles and serratus muscles; (b) skin involvement (ulceration or macroscopic nodules); \\ninvasion of the dermis alone does not qualify as T4b\\n  •  T4a: Extension to the chest wall including muscularis pectoralis major (invasion or \\nadherence to pectoralis muscle in the absence of invasion of chest wall structures does not \\nqualify as T4)\\n  •  T4b: Edema, peau d’orange, ulceration, macroscopic satellite skin nodules in the \\nipsilateral breast (not an inflammatory carcinoma)\\n  • T4c: a\\xa0+\\xa0b\\n  • T4d: Inflammatory breast cancer\\naSmall microscopic satellite foci of the tumor around the primary tumor do not appreciably alter \\ntumor volume and are not added to the maximum size (AJCC 8th).

A cutoff of 1% of tumor cells is recommended \\nfor a specimen to be considered positive for ER or PR because clinical data have \\nindicated that these patients can respond to hormonal treatment [3].\\n2 Breast Cancer Staging 103\\nTable 2.3 Pathological classification of regional lymph nodes\\nPathological classification of regional lymph nodes (pN)a\\npNx: Regional lymph nodes cannot be assessed (e.g., previously removed or not removed for \\npathologic study)\\npN0: No regional lymph node metastasis identified histologically\\n  • pN0 (i−): No regional lymph node metastases, immunohistochemistry (IHC) (−)\\n  •  pN0 (i+): Malignant cells in regional lymph nodes no greater than 0.2\\xa0mm [detected by \\nH&E or IHC including isolated tumor cells (ITC)]\\n  •  pN0 (mol−): No regional lymph node metastases, negative molecular findings: RT-PCR (−)\\n  •  pN0 (mol+): Positive molecular findings by reverse transcriptase polymerase chain \\nreaction (RT-PCR) (+); no ITCs detected\\npN1\\n  • pN1mic: Micrometastases >0.2\\xa0mm and/or >200\\xa0cells, ≤2\\xa0mm\\n  • pN1a: Metastases in 1–3 axillary lymph nodes, at least one metastasis greater than 2\\xa0mm\\n  •  pN1b: Metastases in ipsilateral internal mammary nodes (excluding ITCs), with \\nmicrometastasis or macrometastases detected by sentinel lymph node biopsy but not \\nclinically or by imaging\\n  •  pN1c Metastases in 1–3 axillary lymph nodes and metastases in internal mammary nodes \\nwith micrometastasis or macrometastases detected by sentinel lymph node biopsy but not \\nclinically or by imaging (pN1a and pN1b combined)\\npN2\\n  • pN2a: Metastases in 4–9 axillary lymph nodes (at least one tumor deposit >2.0\\xa0mm)\\n  •  pN2b: Metastases in clinically/radiologically detected internal mammary lymph node \\nmetastases (except lymphoscintigraphy) with or without microscopic confirmation in the \\nabsence of axillary lymph node metastases\\npN3\\n  •  pN3a: 10 or more axillary lymph nodes (at least one tumor deposit >2.0\\xa0mm) or \\nmetastases to the infraclavicular (level 3 axillary) lymph nodes\\n  •  pN3b: Metastases in clinically/radiologically detected (except lymphoscintigraphy) \\nipsilateral internal mammary lymph nodes plus at least one axillary lymph node \\nmetastasis, or metastases in more than 3 axillary lymph nodes and internal mammary \\nlymph node micro- or macrometastases detected by SLNB (not clinically/radiologically)\\n  • pN3c: Metastases in ipsilateral supraclavicular lymph nodes\\npM1 Any histologically proven metastases in distant organs or, if in non-regional nodes, \\nmetastases greater than 0.2\\xa0mm\\naThe largest contiguous tumor deposit is used for pN; adjacent satellite tumor deposits are not \\nincluded in the 8th edition\\n HER-2 Test\\nThe most commonly used methods to evaluate HER2/neu in breast cancer are \\nimmunohistochemistry (IHC) and in situ hybridization (ISH).

Clinical nodal (cN) status is defined by \\nclinical and radiographic findings (with or without histologic examination)\\n  •  Postneoadjuvant therapy T should be based on clinical or imaging (ycT) or pathologic \\nfindings (ypT)\\n  •  A subscript is added to the clinical N for both node-negative and node-positive patients \\nto indicate whether the N was derived from clinical examination, fine needle aspiration, \\ncore needle biopsy, or sentinel lymph node biopsy. The “sn” modifier is used if sentinel \\nlymph node evaluation without axillary dissection was performed after neoadjuvant \\ntreatment\\n  •  The post-treatment ypT is defined as the largest contiguous focus of invasive cancer as \\ndefined histopathologically with a subscript to indicate the presence of multiple tumor \\nfoci. The “m” modifier indicates multiple foci of residual tumor. Note: The definition of \\npost- treatment ypT remains controversial and an area in transition\\n  •  Post-treatment nodal metastases no greater than 0.2\\xa0mm are classified as ypN0(i+) as in \\npatients who have not received neoadjuvant systemic therapy. However, patients with this \\nstatus are not considered to have pathologic complete response (pCR)\\n  •  A description of the degree of response to neoadjuvant therapy (complete, partial, no \\nresponse) is collected by the registrar with the post-treatment ypTNM.\\xa0The registrars are \\nrequested to describe how they defined response [by physical examination, imaging \\ntechniques (mammogram, ultrasound, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)), or \\npathologically]\\n  •  If a patient presents with inflammatory disease (cT4d) before neoadjuvant chemotherapy, \\nthe cancer is still classified as inflammatory breast cancer after therapy, regardless of the \\nresponse to neoadjuvant therapy. The post-treatment pathological classification (yPT) \\nshould reflect the identified residual disease, e.g., ypT1a(m)\\n  •  If a patient presents with Ml prior to systemic therapy, they are considered stage IV and \\nremain stage IV, regardless of the response to neoadjuvant therapya\\n  •  Post-neoadjuvant therapy is designated with the “yc” or “yp” prefix. Of note, no stage \\ngroup is assigned if there is a complete pathologic response (CR) to neoadjuvant therapy, \\ne.g., ypT0ypN0Cm0\\n  •  When the only residual cancer in the breast is intralymphatic or intravascular (LVI), the \\ncase cannot be classified as pCR, but the ypT0 category is assigned. The presence of in \\nsitu cancer after treatment in the absence of residual invasive disease constitutes pCR\\n  •  Patients with axillary nodal tumor deposits of any size, including isolated tumor foci less \\nthan 0.2\\xa0mm, are not classified as having pCR\\naThe stage designation may be changed if postsurgical imaging studies reveal the presence of dis-\\ntant metastases, provided that the studies are conducted within 4\\xa0 months of diagnosis in the \\nabsence of disease progression and that the patient has not received neoadjuvant therapy\\nIn 2013 and 2018 updates of the American Society of Clinical Oncology/College \\nof American Pathologists (ASCO/CAP) guidelines were published [4, 16].

The test should be \\nrepeated if possible\\n2018 Update\\n  •  The 2018 update on recommendations for HER2 testing with ISH method cancelled an \\nequivocal result [16]. Instead, forced pathologists to make a judgement as positive or \\nnegative using combination of repeated IHC and dual-probe ISH method. According to \\nfinal update, if the HER2/CEP 17 ratio ≥2.0 and average HER2 copy number is <4.0 the \\nresult should be negative after completion of a work-up. If the average HER2 copy \\nnumber is ≥6.0 and the ratio is <2.0 the result should be positive after completion of a \\nwork-up\\n106 N.

These are based \\non the identification of prognostic gene signatures by using microarrays. Many \\ngroups have attempted to develop genomic tests based on genomic profiling with \\nthe expectation that such tests might better predict clinical outcome than the stan-\\ndard pathological and clinical markers [20–24].\\nThe Expert Panel of AJCC considered incorporating results from multi-gene \\ngenomic profile assays into Pathological Prognostic Stage [2]. The Oncotype DX test \\n(Genomic Health, Redwood, CA, USA) is a quantitative reverse transcriptase–poly-\\nmerase chain reaction (RT–PCR) assay. It measures a panel of 21 genes, including 16 \\ncancer-related (prognostic) genes and five reference genes, and generates a recur-\\nrence score (RS) that classifies patients as low (RS\\xa0<\\xa018), intermediate (RS 18–30), \\nor high (RS\\xa0≥\\xa031) risk of recurrence [20]. The 10-year distant recurrence rates of \\neach category are 6.8%, 14.3%, and 30.5%, respectively. The Trial Assigning \\nIndividualized Options for Treatment (Rx) (TAILORx) study demonstrated that a \\ngroup of TAILORx trial participants with low 21-gene recurrence score (Oncotype \\nDX® Recurrence Score®) of 10 or less who received hormonal therapy alone without \\nchemotherapy had a less than 1% chance of distant recurrence at 5\\xa0years [21, 23, 24]. \\nIn the TAILORx ClinicalTrial, adjuvant endocrine therapy and chemoendocrine ther-\\napy had similar efficacy in women with hormone-receptor-positive, HER2-negative, \\naxillary node-negative breast cancer who had a midrange 21-gene recurrence score \\n[23]. However, the chemotherapy benefit for invasive disease-free survival varied \\nwith the combination of recurrence score and age (p\\xa0=\\xa00.004), with some benefit of \\nchemotherapy found in women 50\\xa0years of age or younger with a recurrence score of \\n16–25. For patients with T1 and T2 hormone receptor-positive, HER-2 negative, and \\nlymph node-negative tumors in the low risk range, these tumors are placed into the \\nsame prognostic group category, T1a-T1bN0M0, regardless of T size.\\n108 N. Cabioglu et al.\\n Conclusion\\nDue to advances in personalized medicine, the last update of AJCC Breast Cancer \\nStaging incorporated more molecular gene assays and new prognostic and predic-\\ntive markers (Tables 2.8, 2.9, 2.10, 2.11, 2.12, 2.13, 2.14, 2.15, 2.16, 2.17, 2.18, and \\n2.19). Clinical and pathological stage tables were incorporated in addition to the \\ntraditional anatomical prognostic stage tables. The pathological stage table is based \\non clinical information, biomarker data, and findings from surgery and resected tis-\\nsue. It is anticipated that updates will be made on a more frequent basis than the 6- \\nto 8-year\\xa0 cycle of TNM revisions, when relevant validated information is \\navailable.\\nTable 2.8 Clinical prognostic stage: HER2-Positive, ER-Positive, PR-Positive\\nT0 T1mi T1 T2 T3 T4\\nAJCC 7th\\nN0 IA IA IIA IIB IIIB IIIB\\nN1mi IB IB IB IIB IIIA IIIA IIIB IIIB\\nN1 IIA IIA IIA IIB IIIA IIIA IIIB IIIB\\nN2 IIIA IIIA IIIA IIIA IIIA IIIA IIIA IIIA IIIA IIIA IIIB IIIB\\nN3 IIIC IIIC IIIC IIIC IIIC IIIC IIIC IIIC IIIC IIIC IIIC IIIC\\nGa 1,2 3 1,2 3 1,2 3 1,2 3 1,2 3 1,2 3\\nAJCC 8th\\nN0 IA IA IB IB IIIA IIIB\\nN1mi IA IA IA IB IIA IIB IIIA IIIB\\nN1 IB IB IB IB IIA IIB IIIA IIIB\\nN2 IIA IIB IIA IIB IIA IIB IIA IIB IIA IIB IIIA IIIB\\nN3 IIIA IIIB IIIA IIIB IIIA IIIB IIIA IIIB IIIA IIIB IIIA IIIB\\nG 1,2 3 1,2 3 1,2 3 1,2 3 1,2 3 1,2 3\\nDifferences between AJCC 7 and AJCC 8\\nAJCC 7th\\nN0 IIA IIB IIIB\\nN1mi IB IB IB IIB IIIA IIIA IIIB\\nN1 IIA IIA IIA IIB IIIA IIIA IIIB\\nN2 IIIA IIIA IIIA IIIA IIIA IIIA IIIA IIIA IIIA IIIA IIIB\\nN3 IIIC IIIC IIIC IIIC IIIC IIIC IIIC IIIC IIIC IIIC IIIC IIIC\\nG 1,2 3 1,2 3 1,2 3 1,2 3 1,2 3 1,2 3\\nAJCC 8th\\nN0 IB IB IIIA\\nN1mi IA IA IB IB IIA IIB IIIA\\nN1 IB IB IB IB IIA IIB IIIA\\nN2 IIA IIB IIA IIB IIA IIB IIA IIB IIA IIB IIIA\\nN3 IIIA IIIB IIIA IIIB IIIA IIIB IIIA IIIB IIIA IIIB IIIA IIIB\\nG 1,2 3 1,2 3 1,2 3 1,2 3 1,2 3 1,2 3\\naG histologic grade\\n2 Breast Cancer Staging 109\\nTable 2.9 Clinical prognostic stage: HER2-Positive, ER or PR-Positive\\nT0 T1mi T1 T2 T3 T4\\nAJCC 7th\\nN0 IA IA IIA IIB IIB IIIB\\nN1mi IB IB IB IIB IIB IIIA IIIB\\nN1 IIA IIA IIA IIB IIB IIIA IIIB\\nN2 IIIA IIIA IIIA IIIA IIIA IIIB\\nN3 IIIC IIIC IIIC IIIC IIIC IIIC\\nG 1,2,3 1,2,3 1,2,3 1,2 3 1,2 3 1,2,3\\nAJCC 8th\\nN0 IA IA IIA IIA IIB IIIB\\nN1mi IA IA IA IIA IIB IIIA IIIB\\nN1 IIA IIA IIA IIA IIB IIIA IIIB\\nN2 IIIA IIIA IIIA IIIA IIIA IIIB\\nN3 IIIB IIIB IIIB IIIB IIIB IIIB\\nG 1,2,3 1,2,3 1,2,3 1,2 3 1,2 3 1,2,3\\nDifferences between AJCC 7 and AJCC 8\\nAJCC 7th\\nN0 IIB\\nN1mi IB IB IB IIB\\nN1 IIB\\nN2\\nN3 IIIC IIIC IIIC IIIC IIIC IIIC\\nG 1,2,3 1,2,3 1,2,3 1,2 3 1,2 3 1,2,3\\nAJCC 8th\\nN0 IIA\\nN1mi IA IA IA IIA\\nN1 IIA\\nN2\\nN3 IIIB IIIB IIIB IIIB IIIB IIIB\\nG 1,2,3 1,2,3 1,2,3 1,2 3 1,2 3 1,2,3\\nTable 2.10 Clinical prognostic stage: HER2-Positive, ER-Negative, PR-Negative\\nT0 T1mi T1 T2 T3 T4\\nAJCC 7th\\nN0 IA IA IIA IIB IIIB\\nN1mi IB IB IB IIB IIIA IIIB\\nN1 IIA IIA IIA IIB IIIA IIIB\\nN2 IIIA IIIA IIIA IIIA IIIA IIIB\\nN3 IIIC IIIC IIIC IIIC IIIC IIIC\\nG 1,2,3 1,2,3 1,2,3 1,2,3 1,2,3 1,2,3\\nAJCC 8th\\nN0 IA IA IIA IIB IIIB\\nN1mi IA IA IA IIB IIIA IIIB\\n(continued)\\n110 N.

In situ carcinoma is divided into ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) or lobular \\ncarcinoma in situ (LCIS). DCIS is characterized by the neoplastic proliferation of \\nepithelial cells confined to the ductal-lobular system of the breast without evidence \\nof invasion through the basement membrane into the surrounding stroma. Invasive \\ncarcinomas can broadly be divided into two categories: invasive carcinoma of no \\nspecial type (NST) and special subtypes.

Yavuz\\n Ductal Carcinoma In\\xa0Situ (DCIS)\\nDCIS is characterized by the neoplastic proliferation of epithelial cells confined to \\nthe ductal-lobular system of the breast without evidence of invasion through the \\nbasement membrane into the surrounding stroma. DCIS encompasses a heteroge-\\nneous group of lesions that differ with regard to their presentation, histopathological \\nfeatures, biological markers, and risk for progression to invasive cancer [1]. \\nApproximately 10–20% of DCIS cases are bilateral.\\nThe non-comedo subtype is further subdivided into the solid, cribriform \\n(Fig.\\xa03.1), micropapillary, and papillary types.\\nRecent grading systems use the nuclear grade alone or in combination with com-\\nedo necrosis [2]. DCIS is generally divided into three grades according to the \\nnuclear features [3, 4]:\\nHigh-Nuclear-Grade DCIS The tumor is composed of large, pleomorphic cells, \\noften with prominent nucleoli. The nuclei are more than 2.5 times the diameter of \\nred blood cells. Chromatin is coarse and clumped, and its distribution is irregular. \\nComedo necrosis is frequent but not necessary. Polarization toward the luminal sur-\\nface is usually lost. Mitoses may be frequent.\\nLow-Nuclear-Grade DCIS The cells are small, monotonous cells that form \\narcades, micropapillae, and cribriform and solid patterns. Their nuclei are uniform \\nand 1.5–2.5 times the size of normal red blood cells. Nuclei are usually small [1]. \\nThe chromatin is finely dispersed. Nucleoli are inconspicuous. Mitoses are sparse, \\nand cell polarization is protected.\\nIntermediate-Nuclear-Grade DCIS When the lesion cannot be assigned eas-\\nily to the high- or low-grade DCIS categories, it is diagnosed as intermediate \\ngrade.\\nIn the presence of foci of different grades, the case should be graded according \\nto the highest grade.\\nFig. 3.1 DCIS of cribriform \\ntype. Atypical cells filling \\nand distending the duct with \\nformation of a secondary \\nlumina\\n3 Pathology of\\xa0Breast Cancer 127\\n Pathology Reporting for\\xa0DCIS\\nA pathology report for DCIS should include the following [2–5]:\\n• Size/extent of the lesion: Precisely measuring the extent of DCIS is often not pos-\\nsible. The volume of the breast tissue that is involved in DCIS is estimated by the \\npathologist based on the preferred sampling method. Mammographic correlation \\nis also necessary, and this information should be provided by the clinician.\\n• Nuclear grade\\n• The presence or absence of necrosis and its type: The type of necrosis can be \\nclassified as punctate or comedo. Comedo necrosis is associated with mammo-\\ngraphic microcalcifications. Punctate necrosis presents small foci or single-cell \\nnecrosis that is indistinct at low magnification.\\n• Architectural pattern(s): Comedo, solid, cribriform, micropapillary and papil-\\nlary patterns are considered in the traditional classification schemes.\\n• Cell polarization: The presence or loss of polarization toward the luminal sur-\\nfaces is considered in some grading Schemes [6].\\n• Location of microcalcifications: When microcalcifications are present, their \\nlocalization should be reported (in DCIS alone, in benign breast tissue, or in \\nboth). This information provides the correlation\\xa0with mammographic findings.\\n• Surgical margin status: The surgeon provides the orientation using sutures or \\nclips. In the presence of microcalcifications, specimen mammography should be \\nprovided. The specimen should be inked by the pathologist, and sampling is \\nperformed using any of several methods, depending on the pathologist’s choice.\\nNecrosis and polarization appear to have secondary importance compared with \\nthe nuclear grade. Sampling the whole lesion is mandatory to exclude any minute \\nfoci of invasion before giving a diagnosis of DCIS.\\n Differential Diagnosis\\n• Lobular carcinoma in situ (LCIS) versus DCIS: DCIS with a solid pattern must \\nsometimes be distinguished from LCIS. This distinction may be difficult. The \\npresence of E-cadherin in immunohistochemical examination may be helpful in \\ncategorizing the case in favor of DCIS.\\n• Usual ductal hyperplasia (UDH) and atypical ductal hyperplasia (ADH) versus \\nlow-grade DCIS: ADH and low-grade DCIS differ in the extent of the  involvement \\nof the duct system. Page and Tavassoli propose that for a lesion to be described \\nas low-grade DCIS, complete involvement should include at least two spaces or \\nbe larger than 2\\xa0mm [7, 8]. Lesions occupying fewer than two spaces or a total \\narea smaller than 2\\xa0mm are called ADH.\\xa0This distinction is imperfect, and the \\nlevels of concordance and consistency in their diagnosis are low [1].\\n• Foci of microinvasion: DCIS extending into a terminal ductal-lobular unit \\n(TDLU) or an adjacent benign proliferative lesion such as sclerosing adenosis \\n(SA) or a radial scar may create the impression of microinvasion. The absence of \\ninvasive foci can be confirmed by immunohistochemistry demonstrating the \\n128 S. Tuzlali and E. Yavuz\\npresence of myoepithelial cells (using antibodies against smooth muscle actin, \\np63, CD10, calponin, etc.) or basement membrane (using antibodies against col-\\nlagen type IV or laminin).\\n Receptor Status\\nMost cases of DCIS are positive for estrogen receptor (ER). Positivity (defined as \\n≥1% of tumor cells) is observed in 70–85% of cases [2, 3]. Expression correlates \\nwith the grade of DCIS. Almost all cases of ER-negative DCIS are of high nuclear \\ngrade. Progesterone receptor (PR) expression is lower than ER expression.\\n Columnar Cell Lesions and\\xa0Flat Epithelial Atypia\\nLesions lacking intraluminal proliferation have long been recognized and have been \\ngiven a variety of names with regard to cell morphology and the presence or absence \\nof atypia.\\nA simplified terminology combining the architecture and nuclear atypia under \\nthe term flat epithelial atypia (FEA) is now widely used [2, 9]:\\n• Columnar cell change (CCC)\\n• Columnar cell hyperplasia (CCH)\\n• Flat epithelial atypia (FEA)\\nCCC and CCH are lesions in the TDLU that are characterized by enlarged, vari-\\nably dilated acini lined by columnar epithelial cells [2]. These lesions are micro-\\nscopic in size and are increasingly detected as mammographic microcalcifications. \\nThe cells have ovoid nuclei that are oriented perpendicularly to the basement mem-\\nbrane, evenly dispersed, fine chromatin, and inconspicuous nucleoli. The lesions are \\nfrequently associated with intraluminal secretion and microcalcification. Lesions in \\nwhich the epithelial lining is composed of one or two cell layers are categorized as \\nCCC.\\xa0If there is a cellular stratification of more than two layers and a piling up of \\nseveral layers, the term CCH is used.\\nColumnar cell lesions are associated with a very low risk for subsequent devel-\\nopment of invasive breast cancer, and these lesions do not increase this risk indepen-\\ndent of concurrent proliferative changes [10].\\nFEA: Lesions exhibiting cellular atypia in addition to the architectural patterns \\ndescribed for CCC and CCH are categorized as FEA.\\xa0FEA is characterized by the \\nreplacement of native epithelial cells with one to several layers of monotonous, \\ncuboidal to columnar cells with low-grade cytologic atypia. The cells often have \\napical snouts. Well-developed bridges or arcades are absent.\\nA lesion with low-grade nuclear features that has well-developed bridges, \\narcades, or bulbous micropapillae should be diagnosed as ADH or low-grade DCIS \\ndepending on the size of the lesion (see above). The risk of subsequent invasive \\nbreast cancer in FEA is low and is substantially lower than the risk associated with \\n3 Pathology of\\xa0Breast Cancer 129\\nestablished forms of ADH [2]. FEA is often associated with ADH, low-grade DCIS, \\nlobular neoplasia (LN), and tubular carcinoma (TC).\\nIn contrast to the normal breast and UDH, where ER and PR immunostaining is \\nheterogeneous and limited to approximately 10–15% of cells, CCL and FEA pres-\\nent diffuse and homogenous staining in all lesional cells. Most cells show immunos-\\ntaining for low-molecular-weight cytokeratins and are negative for CK5/6.\\n Lobular Neoplasia\\nLobular Carcinoma In Situ (LCIS) The entire spectrum of atypical epithelial \\nlesions originating in the TDLU of the breast, characterized by the proliferation of \\ngenerally small, dyscohesive cells, is called LN.\\xa0Proliferating cells are cuboidal or \\npolygonal monotonous and poorly cohesive cells with clear or light cytoplasm. \\nWhen more than half of the acini of a lobular unit are distended and distorted, the \\nlesion is called LCIS (Fig.\\xa03.2). Less involvement with cells showing the same char-\\nacteristics is called ALH [7].\\nPleomorphic LCIS The cells are markedly pleomorphic with large nuclei. Central \\nnecrosis and microcalcifications may be present [11].\\nThe morphological distinction from solid-type DCIS is discussed above. LN is \\nalmost uniformly positive for ER and PR and negative for E-cadherin. Classical \\nLCIS and LCIS with comedo necrosis are negative for HER2 and p53 and have a \\nlow Ki-67 index. However, pleomorphic LCIS may have HER2 and p53 overex-\\npression and moderate to high Ki-67 [12].\\nLN is classically accepted as a risk indicator of breast cancer development for \\nboth breasts; however, recent, carefully conducted cohort studies suggest that the risk \\nis higher in the ipsilateral breast (68% versus 24%) [13]. The available clinical and \\nFig. 3.2 Lobular carcinoma \\nin situ. The breast terminal \\nductal-lobular unit (TDLU) is \\ndistended by atypical, \\nhomogenous-appearing cells\\n130 S. Tuzlali and E. Yavuz\\nmolecular evidence suggests that ALH and LCIS are clonal and neoplastic and that \\nthese lesions are both risk indicators and non-obligate precursors of breast cancer \\n[14]. Florid LCIS: This is a growth pattern of LCIS in which neoplastic cells expand \\nthe ducts in a solid architectural pattern similar to solid pattern of DCIS, without \\nhaving the degree of atypia of pleomprhic LCIS.\\xa0The florid form of LCIS is more \\nfrequently associated with an invasive component than the nonflorid form (87% ver-\\nsus 73%, respectively). The invasive component is lobular in 100% of florid LCIS \\nlesions but only 82% of nonflorid LCIS lesions [15]. Recent evidence also suggests \\nthat the florid form of LCIS is genetically more advanced compared with the indolent \\nphenotype of classic LCIS. This difference may explain the higher frequency of con-\\ncurrent invasive carcinoma in florid LCIS compared with classic LCIS [16].\\n Microinvasive Carcinoma\\nThis tumor is characterized by one or more clearly separate microscopic foci of \\ninfiltration of tumor cells into the mammary stroma, each less than or equal to 1\\xa0mm \\nin size, and is most commonly seen in a background of high-grade DCIS [2, 17]. \\nThe tumor is accompanied by stromal edema and desmoplasia and inflammatory \\ninfiltration [2]. This entity is commonly overdiagnosed. Central consultation usu-\\nally downgrades the lesion [18].\\nThe prognosis is not clearly different from patients with DCIS of equivalent \\ngrade (Figs.\\xa03.1 and 3.2).\\n Invasive Carcinomas\\nInvasive carcinomas can broadly be divided into two categories, invasive carcinoma \\nof no special type (NST) and special subtypes [2].\\nInvasive carcinoma NST and invasive lobular carcinoma (ILC) constitute the \\nmajor types of breast carcinoma. The cytoarchitectural and spread patterns of some \\ncarcinomas are sufficiently distinctive to be recognized as special subtypes, espe-\\ncially when associated with a particular behavior [19].\\nAccording to the recent WHO classification, invasive breast carcinomas are clas-\\nsified as indicated in Table\\xa03.1 [2].\\n Invasive Carcinoma of\\xa0No Special Type (NST)\\nThis carcinoma is the most common type of invasive breast cancer and represents \\nup to 75% of cases in published series. Terms such as infiltrating ductal carcinoma \\nand invasive ductal carcinoma, not otherwise specified (NOS), are also used. \\n3 Pathology of\\xa0Breast Cancer 131\\nTable 3.1 WHO Invasive carcinoma of no special type\\nclassification of breast cancer Pleomorphic carcinoma\\nCarcinoma with osteoclast-like stromal giant cells\\nCarcinoma with choriocarcinomatous features\\nCarcinoma with melanocytic features\\nSpecial types\\nInvasive lobular carcinoma\\n Classical lobular carcinoma\\n Solid lobular carcinoma\\n Alveolar lobular carcinoma\\n Pleomorphic lobular carcinoma\\n Tubulolobular carcinoma\\n Mixed lobular carcinoma\\nTubular carcinoma\\nCribriform carcinoma\\nMucinous carcinoma\\nCarcinoma with medullary features\\nMedullary carcinoma\\n Atypical medullary carcinoma\\n Invasive carcinoma NST with medullary features\\n Carcinoma with apocrine differentiation\\nCarcinoma with signet ring cell differentiation\\nInvasive micropapillary carcinoma\\nMetaplastic carcinoma of no special type\\n Low-grade adenosquamous carcinoma\\n Fibromatosis-like metaplastic carcinoma\\n Squamous cell carcinoma\\n Spindle cell carcinoma\\n Metaplastic carcinoma with mesenchymal \\ndifferentiation\\n  Chondroid differentiation\\n  Osseous differentiation\\n  Other types of mesenchymal differentiation\\n Mixed metaplastic carcinoma\\n Myoepithelial carcinoma\\nEpithelial-myoepithelial tumors\\nAdenomyoepithelioma with carcinoma\\nAdenoid cystic carcinoma\\nRare types\\nCarcinoma with neuroendocrine features\\n Neuroendocrine tumor, well differentiated\\n Neuroendocrine carcinoma, poorly differentiated \\n(small-cell carcinoma)\\n Carcinoma with neuroendocrine differentiation\\n(continued)\\n132 S.

[2]\\nFig. 3.3 Invasive ductal \\ncarcinoma of no special type \\n(NST). Islands are formed \\nby cohesive cells with \\ndiscernible cytoplasmic \\nborders\\nA\\xa0tumor should be called invasive ductal carcinoma (IDC) NST if it cannot be cat-\\negorized as one of the special or rare types.\\nGross Features IDC NST has no specific gross features. It also shows a great \\nvariation in size, ranging from a few millimeters to huge masses. In typical cases, \\nthese tumors have irregular, stellate borders. They have a firm consistency, and their \\ncut surface is generally gray-white with a gritty sensation. Less frequently, the \\ntumor may have a nodular configuration with a softer consistency.\\nMicroscopic Features The tumor cells are arranged in sheets, clusters, cords, tra-\\nbeculae, and glands/tubules or sometimes in a solid pattern with no or little inter-\\nvening stroma (Fig.\\xa03.3). Cellular features also show great variability. Nuclei may \\nbe uniform and regular or highly pleomorphic with very prominent and multiple \\nnucleoli. Mitotic activity is also highly variable.\\nIDC NST may have histopathological characteristics of special types. In IDC \\nNST, at least 50% of the tumor should be composed of a nonspecialized type. The \\ntumor stroma may be abundant. When a proportion of specialized histopathological \\nforms accompany the IDC NST, these carcinomas are described as “mixed type” [2].\\n3 Pathology of\\xa0Breast Cancer 133\\nPleomorphic carcinoma, carcinoma with osteoclast-like stromal giant cells, car-\\ncinoma with choriocarcinomatous features, and carcinoma with melanocytic fea-\\ntures are not recognized as distinct special types but as variants of IDC NST [2]. The \\nlatter two are exceptionally rare.\\n Pleomorphic Carcinoma\\nPleomorphic carcinoma is characterized by the proliferation of bizarre, highly ana-\\nplastic, and sometimes multinucleated cells. Approximately one-third of cases have \\na metaplastic spindle cell component [20, 21]. This prognostically unfavorable \\ntumor represents the extreme end of the morphological spectrum of grade III infil-\\ntrating ductal carcinoma [20].\\n Carcinoma with\\xa0Osteoclast-Like Stromal Giant Cells\\nThe distinctive feature is the presence of osteoclastic giant cells (OGCs). \\nGrossly, they have a striking red-brown cut section with a hemorrhagic appear-\\nance. The stroma is hypervascular with recent and old hemorrhages. The associ-\\nated carcinomas are mostly well to moderately differentiated, showing a \\nrelatively more common cribriform pattern. OGCs are positive for CD 68, acid \\nphosphatase, and lysozyme but negative for cytokeratin and alkaline phospha-\\ntase [22–25].\\nThe immunohistochemical profile, along with the absence of any epithelial \\nfeatures in ultrastructural examination, supports the histiocytic origin of these \\ncells [24]. They also express osteoclast markers and appear to form in response \\nto the specific hypervascular stroma, which secretes matrix-metalloprotein-\\nase-12 (MMP- 12) and cytokines such as vascular endothelial growth factor \\n(VEGF) [26].\\nAxillary lymph node involvement has been reported in one third of cases [23, \\n24]. The 5-year survival rate is approximately 70%, which is similar to or slightly \\nbetter than in patients with ordinary invasive ductal carcinoma [2].\\n Invasive Lobular Carcinoma\\nILC is a carcinoma composed of non-cohesive cells that are individually dispersed \\nor arranged in a single-file linear pattern in a fibrous stroma [2]. ILC represents \\n5–15% of invasive breast carcinomas [2]. In most series, its incidence is approxi-\\nmately 10% [24]. Lobular differentiation accompanying IDC NST is observed in \\napproximately 5% of invasive breast cancers [2].\\n134 S. Tuzlali and E. Yavuz\\nFig. 3.4 Invasive lobular \\ncarcinoma. Single, uniform, \\nsmall, non-cohesive cells \\naround a duct space\\nILC frequently presents as a mass with irregular borders that sometimes cannot \\nbe defined macroscopically, and the breast tissue appears normal with only a firm \\nconsistency by palpation [23]. The size ranges from occult, microscopic lesions to \\ntumors that diffusely involve the entire breast [23]. Occasionally ILC forms numer-\\nous, fine, hard nodules that grossly and microscopically mimic sclerosing adenosis \\ngrossly and microscopically. The incidence of synchronous or metachronous bilat-\\neral carcinoma in ILCs is almost twice that observed in IDCs [27, 28].\\n Classical ILC\\nILC is characterized by the proliferation of small, uniform cells that lack cohesion \\nand are dispersed individually in a fibrous stroma or arranged in linear cords \\n(Fig.\\xa03.4). These cords usually present a concentric pattern around nonneoplastic \\nducts, forming a “targetoid pattern”. The tumor cells are bland or monotonous and \\nhave round to ovoid nuclei. Mitoses are uncommon.\\nILC has some histological variants: solid, alveolar, tubulolobular and pleomor-\\nphic [29].\\n Pleomorphic Variant\\nPleomorphic ILC exhibits the growth pattern of classical ILC but a greater degree \\nof cellular atypia and pleomorphism and a higher mitotic rate than classical \\nILC.\\xa0These cells retain their lobular characteristics with a single-file and/or target-\\noid arrangement and non-cohesive appearance. LCIS is present in 45–60% of cases \\n[11, 30, 31] and is frequently of the pleomorphic type [31]. Pleomorphic ILC may \\nshow apocrine [11] or histiocytoid [32, 33] differentiation and may be composed of \\nsignet ring cells [2].\\n3 Pathology of\\xa0Breast Cancer 135\\n Mixed Type\\nThese cases exhibit mixtures of the abovementioned variants; Dixon [27] noted that \\n“none of these patterns are prominent.”\\nILC is almost invariably ER positive. PR positivity is present in approximately \\n70–80% of cases. Her-2 positivity is very rare and is generally limited to p leomorphic \\nILC.\\xa0 Immunohistochemically, E-cadherin is absent or reduced in ILC compared \\nwith IDC.\\xa0However, a subset of ILCs express E-cadherin, ranging from 10 to 16% \\nof ILCs [34, 35], and this subset is described as aberrant without any significance or \\nany correlation with known prognostic parameters [35, 36].\\nMost ILCs also show a loss of membrane-specific catenin immunoreactivity in \\nparallel to E-cadherin loss [34] and mislocalization of catenin p120\\xa0in the cytoplasm \\n[37].\\nIn general, ILCs have more favorable prognostic features than IDC NST.\\xa0 A \\nhigher frequency of ILC was placed in the good Nottingham Prognostic Index group \\n(40% compared with 21% for IDC) [38] and has a better or similar outcome in the \\nshort-term period (first 6–10\\xa0years). However, the long-term outcome for ILC is \\nworse than that for IDC NST [38, 39]. A more favorable outcome is reported for the \\nclassical type than the pleomorphic type [23]. Differences in outcomes between \\nvariant forms and classical ILC are not statistically significant [23]. Rakha et\\xa0al. \\nfound that survival in patients with pleomorphic lobular carcinoma was associated \\nwith mitotic score but not nuclear pleomorphism [40].\\nDistinctive patterns of metastases are associated with ILC.\\xa0ILC shows a higher \\nfrequency of metastases in the intra-abdominal serosal surfaces and retroperito-\\nneum, leptomeninges, gastrointestinal tract, and gynecological organs and a lower \\nfrequency of pulmonary metastases [2, 22–24].\\n Tubular Carcinoma\\nTubular carcinoma (TC) is a low-grade (grade I) carcinoma with a particularly \\nfavorable prognosis. It is composed of well-differentiated tubular structures lined by \\na single layer of cells and has open lumina. Pure TC accounts for approximately 2% \\nof invasive breast cancers. Its frequency is higher in populations where screening \\nmammography is used. TC is more likely to be smaller lesions with less frequent \\nnodal involvement and a better outcome than IDC NST.\\nTC often presents as an ill-defined, gray-white, firm to hard, stellate mass with \\nan average size of 1.3\\xa0cm (0.2–5\\xa0cm). The cut surfaces frequently show elastotic, \\nyellow streaks. Microscopically, the tubules are haphazardly arranged in a typical \\ndesmoplastic stroma. The lumina of the tubules are oval or rounded with angulated \\nends (Fig.\\xa03.5). The single cells lining these tubules have mild nuclear pleomor-\\nphism with inconspicuous nucleoli, and they exhibit very few mitoses. The myoepi-\\nthelial cell layer and basal membrane are lacking in contrast to nonneoplastic \\nproliferations. TC occurs in association with FEA and low-grade DCIS.\\n136 S. Tuzlali and E. Yavuz\\nFig. 3.5 Tubular carcinoma. \\nWell-differentiated tubular \\nstructures lined by a single \\nlayer of cells\\nA carcinoma is a pure tubular carcinoma when 90% or more of the tumor \\nconsists of tubules [41]. Patients diagnosed with TC with this cut-off and small \\nlesions have the same overall survival as the age-matched general population \\n[41, 42].\\nTubule formation in less than 90% of the tumor should be regarded as mixed \\ntype. One exception that should be considered is the cribriform pattern. In the pres-\\nence of invasive cribriform carcinoma (ICC) intermingled with TC, these areas are \\nalso regarded as tubule formation.\\nDifferential Diagnosis Microglandular adenosis (MGA): Glands in MGA are \\nmore rounded and regular and contain secretory material [2, 24]. The myoepithe-\\nlium is lacking in both types of lesions, and immunostaining reveals no staining \\nfor calponin, p63, CD10, or cytokeratin 5. The basement membrane is lacking in \\nTC, which can be demonstrated around the glands of MGA by periodic acid-\\nSchiff (PAS) staining and immunostaining for collagen IV and laminin [2, 22–\\n24]. Epithelial membrane antigen (EMA), which is present in TC, is absent in \\nMGA [24].\\n• Sclerosing adenosis (SA): SA is a lobulocentric proliferation containing myoepi-\\nthelial cells and basement membrane. TC does not have a lobulocentric growth \\npattern and does not contain myoepithelial cells or a basement membrane.\\n• Complex sclerosing lesion (CSL) (radial scar): The central fibroelastotic core of \\nthis lesion may have a few, distorted, entrapped, pseudoinfiltrative glands, creat-\\ning diagnostic difficulty through its resemblance to TC.\\xa0The glands at the periph-\\nery of the core are hyperplastic and dilated. This zoning phenomenon is lacking \\nin TC.\\xa0 The glands in CSL also contain myoepithelial cells and a basement \\nmembrane.\\n3 Pathology of\\xa0Breast Cancer 137\\nWomen with “pure” TC have an excellent prognosis. The frequency of axillary \\nlymph node metastasis is approximately 10%. TC has a better prognosis than do \\ngrade I IDC or tubular mixed carcinomas, independent of other prognostic factors \\n[41, 42]. In a follow-up of 127\\xa0months (4–217\\xa0months), recurrent disease was found \\nin 13.2% of patients with TCs, with no cancer-specific deaths, compared with \\npatients with grade I IDCs, in which the recurrent disease rate was 29.4% and the \\ncancer-specific death rate was 9% [41].\\n Invasive Cribriform Carcinoma\\nICC is a low-grade carcinoma with excellent prognosis in which the majority of the \\ninvasive component shows a cribriform pattern of growth. Pure ICC consists of an \\ninvasive cribriform pattern in more than 90% of the tumor [43, 44].\\n Differential Diagnosis\\nAdenoid cystic carcinoma (ACC) ICC most closely resembles ACC.\\xa0ICC is com-\\nposed of one cell type and lacks the basal-myoepithelial type. Tumor cells are dif-\\nfusely positive for ER.\\xa0In ACC, there are two cell types, basal-myoepithelial and \\nluminal; ACC also shows a triple-negative immunoprofile.\\nCribriform DCIS ICC has a more irregular and angular cribriform pattern with a \\nmore haphazard distribution compared with cribriform DCIS. Cribriform DCIS has \\na myoepithelial cell layer around the cribriform structures.\\nIn invasive cribriform carcinomas, 100% of cases are ER positive, 69% of cases \\nare PR positive [45], and HER2 expression is absent [24]. The prognosis of ICC is \\nfavorable [44] and similar to that of TC [43]. The 10-year overall survival is \\n90–100% [44, 45].\\n Carcinoma with\\xa0Medullary Features\\nThese tumors exhibit some or all of the following features:\\n• a circumscribed or pushing border,\\n• syncytial growth pattern,\\n• cells with high-grade nuclei, and\\n138 S. Tuzlali and E. Yavuz\\n• prominent lymphoid infiltration.\\nIn the recent WHO classification, these tumors are categorized into three groups \\nunder the heading “Carcinomas with medullary features” as follows [2]:\\n• Medullary carcinoma (MC)\\n• Atypical MC\\n• IDC NST with medullary features\\nThe criteria that distinguish these groups are vague and have poor interobserver \\nreproducibility.\\nDistinguishing between the last two groups is particularly difficult. In our insti-\\ntutional practice, we prefer to reserve the term MC for tumors that exhibit all of the \\nfeatures described above using very strict criteria and to call the tumors that exhibit \\nsome of these features atypical MC.\\nDespite having poor clinicopathological features, patients with medullary histol-\\nogy demonstrate favorable long-term distant relapse-free survival compared with \\npatients with IDC NST.\\xa0The local control rates of MC and IDC are comparable [46].\\nIn a retrospective study of 165 cases of basal-like carcinomas, the Nottingham \\ngroup found that prominent inflammation and anastomosing sheets in at least 30% \\nof the tumor were associated with better prognosis in a univariate analysis [47]. The \\ncombination of these two features was present in 17% of tumors and was an inde-\\npendent prognostic factor in a multivariate analysis. They also proposed a simplified \\ndefinition of medullary-like type based on these two features [47].\\n Mucinous Carcinoma\\nMucinous carcinoma is characterized by the production of extracellular and/or \\nintracellular mucinous material. A lesion is called pure mucinous carcinoma if the \\nmucinous component constitutes more than 90% of the lesion [48]. Mucinous car-\\ncinoma is also observed as part of a mixed carcinoma with IDC NST.\\xa0The axillary \\nlymph nodes are rarely involved. Gross examination of mucinous carcinomas \\nreveals a circumscribed, gelatinous mass with pushing margins and soft consis-\\ntency. The cut surface has a glistening appearance. Confluent hemorrhagic areas are \\nfrequent [24].\\nThe tumor size ranges from 0.5 to 20\\xa0cm. Despite these large diameters, axillary \\nnodal involvement is infrequent. Microscopically, there are clusters of tumor cells \\nfloating in mucin lakes separated by delicate fibrovascular septae. The clusters are \\nvariable in size. Mucinous carcinoma can be divided into two categories: types A \\nand B [49]:\\nType A mucinous carcinoma: This is the classical or non-endocrine variant and \\nis characterized by larger quantities of mucin. Mucin is always extracellular [24].\\n3 Pathology of\\xa0Breast Cancer 139\\nType B mucinous carcinoma: This type is more cellular with large clusters and \\nhas frequent neuroendocrine differentiation. Intracytoplasmic mucin is abundant in \\nthis type.\\nMucinous carcinoma is usually positive for ER and PR and negative for HER2.\\nThe most important entity in the differential diagnosis is the “mucocele-like \\nlesion” [48]. Mucinous carcinoma should also be distinguished from myxoid fibro-\\nadenomas, especially in fine-needle aspiration biopsies. Mucinous carcinomas have \\na favorable outcome [42]. In a follow-up series of 11,400 cases of pure mucinous \\ncarcinoma, the 5-, 10-, 15-, and 20-year survival rates were 94, 89, 85, and 81%, \\nrespectively [50]. Nodal involvement was associated with significant disease-free \\nsurvival and overall survival [42]. The separation of cases as types A and B has no \\nclinical significance.\\n Carcinomas with\\xa0Signet Ring Cell Differentiation\\nCells with signet ring cell differentiation have abundant mucin in their cytoplasm, \\nwhich pushes the nucleus to one side, creating the typical signet ring cell appear-\\nance (Fig.\\xa03.6). This is generally seen as a focal differentiation. Prominent signet \\nring cell differentiation is most common in ILC.\\xa0Occasionally, these cases should be \\ndifferentiated from gastrointestinal metastasis. The presence of an in situ compo-\\nnent is a sign in favor of primary breast cancer. In difficult cases, steroid receptor \\nexpression and antibodies specific to breast carcinoma such as GCDFP, mammaglo-\\nbin or GATA-3 are helpful. The prognostic importance of signet ring cell differen-\\ntiation is uncertain [2].\\nFig. 3.6 Carcinoma with \\nsignet ring cell \\ndifferentiation. Infiltration of \\ntumor cells with vacuolated \\ncytoplasm resembling a \\nsignet ring\\n140 S. Tuzlali and E. Yavuz\\n Carcinoma with\\xa0Apocrine Differentiation\\nThis type includes any invasive carcinoma having cells with cytological features of \\napocrine differentiation. These cells have abundant, eosinophilic, granular cyto-\\nplasm and large nuclei with prominent nucleoli. Focal apocrine differentiation is not \\nvery rare. ER and PR expression is usually negative. Androgen receptor (AR) posi-\\ntivity is encountered in more than 70% of apocrine carcinomas. GCDFP-15 is char-\\nacteristic but not specific for apocrine cells [24, 51]. From a practical perspective, \\nwe do not call tumors pure apocrine carcinoma if there is ER or PR expression. AR \\nexpression in ER-/PR-/HER2+ tumors, which commonly show apocrine differenti-\\nation, and a subset of triple-negative apocrine tumors suggests that these tumors \\ntogether form a molecular apocrine group [52].\\nA recent study with long-term follow-up revealed that patients with pure apo-\\ncrine carcinomas (negative for ER and PR and positive for AR) have shorter disease- \\nfree survival than patients with IDC NST and apocrine-like IDC (ER or PR positive \\nand AR negative) [53].\\n Invasive Micropapillary Carcinoma (IMPC)\\nIMPC accounts for 0.9–1.7% of all invasive breast carcinomas, when occurring in \\npure form, and up to 7.6%, when admixed with other types of mammary carcinoma \\n[54, 55]. Most patients present with a palpable mass [55]. The tumor is composed \\nof small, hollow, or morula-like clusters of tumor cells that lack fibrovascular cores \\nand are surrounded by clear stromal spaces. The presence of an in situ component is \\nhelpful in excluding rare cases of metastatic ovarian serous papillary carcinoma to \\nthe breast.\\nMost cases are grade 2 or 3 carcinomas, and the majority are ER and PR posi-\\ntive. HER2 overexpression is present in less than 10–35% of cases [2]. IMPCs \\npresent more frequently with lymphovascular invasion and lymph node metasta-\\nsis when compared with the IDC NST [56]. However, the association of this his-\\ntology with survival remains unclear. In a recent series of 49 patients, IMPC \\nhistology did not add any independent information to the risk of locoregional or \\ndistant relapse or to overall survival [57]. Meng et\\xa0al. [58] found prostate stem \\ncell antigen (PSCA) gene amplification in 45.2% (14/31) and PSCA protein \\nexpression in 58.9% (33/56) of cases of IMPC.\\xa0 These percentages are signifi-\\ncantly high compared with IDC NST and may be used as a molecular marker of \\nworse prognosis. In a recent study, we found that the loss of ARID1A expression \\nand Her-2 positivity have significant adverse effects for clinical outcomes of \\nIMPC patients [59].\\n3 Pathology of\\xa0Breast Cancer 141\\n Metaplastic Carcinoma\\nMetaplastic carcinoma encompasses a group of neoplasms that are characterized by \\nthe differentiation of the neoplastic epithelium into squamous and/or mesenchymal- \\nlooking elements, including but not restricted to spindle, chondroid, osseous, and \\nrhabdomyoid cells [2]. The tumor may be entirely composed of metaplastic ele-\\nments or may include a mixture of carcinoma and metaplastic elements. Its inci-\\ndence is less than 1% [60, 61]. The mean size is 3.4–4.4\\xa0cm [60].\\nThese tumors can present either as a circumscribed nodule or as a mass with \\nindistinct borders. Cystic changes can occur, especially in cases that are accompa-\\nnied by squamous cell carcinoma (SCC).\\nThe recent WHO classification [2] categorizes metaplastic carcinomas in a \\ndescriptive manner:\\n•  Low-Grade Adenosquamous Carcinoma (LGASC)\\nThis tumor is similar to the infiltrating syringomatous tumors of the salivary \\nglands and microcystic adnexal carcinomas of the skin of the lip [62]. Patients \\npresent with a palpable mass [63], and grossly, the tumors are smaller than other \\nforms of metaplastic carcinoma [23]. They have a hard consistency and ill-\\ndefined borders [63]. Squamous differentiation may be extensive, with large \\nkeratinizing cyst formations. In our experience, this rare tumor is an underdiag-\\nnosed entity and therefore may be left untreated; during their long evolution, \\nthey recur and metastasize.\\n•  Fibromatosis-Like Metaplastic Carcinoma\\nThis tumor is characterized by bland spindle cells having slender nuclei with \\ntapered ends. Nuclear atypia is mild or absent. Focal squamous differentiation is \\nobserved. Because of the bland appearance of tumor cells, this tumor may be underdi-\\nagnosed as benign. The tumor is always positive for keratins [64] and p63 [2]. In a \\nrecent study, Takano et\\xa0al. [65] demonstrated that these tumors are characterized by \\nlow genomic instability and share no copy number aberrations with other metaplastic \\ncarcinomas. Local recurrence can occur after local excision, and distant metastases \\noccur occasionally.\\n•  Squamous Cell Carcinoma\\nGrossly, squamous cell carcinoma is often a cystic lesion [2]. The cavity \\nis lined by squamous cells, often with bland nuclear features. The infiltrating \\nsquamous cells form sheets and nests with varying degrees of differentiation. \\nCombinations of patterns with transition to spindle cells or to less differenti-\\nated forms may occur. An origin from the overlying skin should be excluded. \\nSCC may be mixed with IDC NST.\\xa0Focal squamous differentiation can also \\nbe found in IDC NST and may accompany carcinomas with medullary \\nfeatures.\\n142 S. Tuzlali and E. Yavuz\\n•  Spindle Cell Carcinoma\\nThis tumor is characterized by the pseudosarcomatous growth pattern of its \\nneoplastic spindle cells. The distinction between spindle cell carcinoma and pri-\\nmary sarcomas of the breast, including fibrosarcoma and malignant fibrous his-\\ntiocytoma, may be problematic. Epithelial differentiation can be demonstrated \\nby immunohistochemistry using a panel of antibodies (high-molecular-weight \\ncytokeratins). P63 staining is also very common [66].\\n•  Metaplastic Carcinoma with\\xa0Mesenchymal Differentiation\\nThese tumors display an admixture of carcinomatous and mesenchymal ele-\\nments. Mesenchymal components include chondroid, osseous, and rhabdomyoid \\nelements with varying degrees of differentiation. Metaplastic carcinomas often \\ncontain a mixture of different elements.\\n•  Matrix-Producing Carcinoma\\nThis is a subgroup of metaplastic carcinomas that show an abrupt transi-\\ntion from epithelial to mesenchymal elements without intervening spindle \\ncells.\\nMore than 90% of metaplastic carcinomas are triple-negative cancers and \\nexpress keratin 5/6/14 and EGFR [2]. Immunohistochemically, they show a \\nbasal-like phenotype, regardless of the types of metaplastic elements. They also \\noverexpress EGFR in more than half of cases [67, 68]. Gene expression profiling \\nhas  demonstrated that metaplastic carcinomas are part of the spectrum of basal-\\nlike breast carcinomas and display a myoepithelial and epithelial-to-mesenchy-\\nmal transition-l ike molecular composition [69, 70]. However, there is no \\nconsistent immunophenotype, and no individual marker is positive in 100% of \\ncases. Antibodies to a broad spectrum of cytokeratins (AE1/AE3 and MNF116) \\nare most frequently positive (approximately 80%) [71].\\nMBCs are genetically complex and heterogeneous, and mutations in PI3K/\\nAKT/mTOR pathway-related and canonical Wnt pathway-related genes are sig-\\nnificantly more common than triple-negative IDC NST [72].\\nLymph node metastases are less frequent in metaplastic carcinomas than in IDC \\nNST.\\xa0However, distant metastasis can occur in the absence of lymph node metasta-\\nsis, as observed in other triple-negative breast cancers [2].\\n Carcinomas with\\xa0Neuroendocrine Features\\nThese carcinomas exhibit morphological and immunohistochemical features of \\nendocrine tumors, similar to those observed in the gastrointestinal tract and lung. In \\nthe recent WHO classification [2], neuroendocrine breast carcinomas are catego-\\nrized as follows:\\n• Neuroendocrine tumor, well-differentiated\\n• Neuroendocrine carcinoma, poorly differentiated/small-cell carcinoma\\n• Invasive breast carcinoma with neuroendocrine differentiation\\n3 Pathology of\\xa0Breast Cancer 143\\nInvasive cancers of NST and other special types may show endocrine differentia-\\ntion. These tumors do not have any specific clinical presentation.\\n•  Well-Differentiated Neuroendocrine Tumor\\nThe tumor consists of densely cellular, solid nests and trabeculae of cells \\nseparated by a thin fibrovascular stroma [73]. These tumors are of low or inter-\\nmediate grade (2). There is chromogranin positivity in more than 50% of cases \\n[74]. Other endocrine markers, such as synaptophysin and CD 56, are also posi-\\ntive. These tumors are typically positive for ER and PR and negative for HER2.\\n•  Neuroendocrine Carcinoma\\nThe tumor is composed of highly atypical cells with hyperchromatic nuclei \\nand scant cytoplasm. Mitotic figures are frequent, and necrosis may accompany \\nthe lesion. The tumor should be distinguished from metastatic small-cell carci-\\nnoma of the lung; this distinction cannot be made on the sole basis of morphol-\\nogy. The presence of an in situ component supports the diagnosis of the breast as \\nthe primary cancer. Monoclonal NSE is positive in all cases of small-cell carci-\\nnomas, and other neuroendocrine markers are positive in approximately 50% of \\ncases [2]. ER and PR expression may also be observed in more than 50% of cases \\nand is generally correlated with the degree of differentiation. Small-cell carci-\\nnoma is negative for HER2 expression [74, 75].\\n•  Invasive Breast Carcinoma with\\xa0Neuroendocrine Differentiation\\nMucinous carcinoma of type B and solid papillary carcinoma (SPC) are the \\nmost frequent examples of this category [2, 75].\\n Secretory Carvcinoma\\nSecretory carcinoma presents as a well-circumscribed mobile mass. The median \\nage of presentation is 25\\xa0years. Microscopically, the characteristic finding is the \\npresence of intracellular and extracellular secretory material showing positive stain-\\ning with PAS.\\xa0ER, PR, and HER2 are absent. EMA, alpha-lactalbumin, and S-100 \\nprotein are frequently present. There is a high expression rate of basal-like markers \\n(CK5/6 or epidermal growth factor receptor) in secretory carcinomas [75]. Tognon \\net\\xa0al. [76] showed that 12 of 13 of their cases of secretory breast carcinoma expressed \\nthe ETV6-NTRK3 gene fusion. Secretory carcinoma has an indolent clinical behav-\\nior, especially in children and young adults [75].\\n Papillary Lesions\\nThese lesions, especially from the clinical perspective, are often confused with each \\nother. For this reason, all of them will be discussed consecutively under the title \\n“papillary lesions.”\\n144 S. Tuzlali and E. Yavuz\\n•  Intraductal Papillary Carcinoma (IDPC)\\nIDPC is a malignant, noninvasive neoplastic epithelial proliferation with pap-\\nillary architectural features that occurs in the lumen of the ductal-lobular system \\n[2]. Two types of IDPC exist:\\n– Central, solitary: Presentation may include nipple discharge.\\n– Peripheral, multifocal: Presentation may be as a mass.\\nMicroscopically, ducts or the TDLU is filled with slender, branching fibrovas-\\ncular stalks, lined by a single layer or several layers of monomorphic epithelial \\ncells. High-grade nuclear features are rare. Solid, cribriform, and micropapillary \\npatterns also exist. There is complete or near-complete (90%) absence of myo-\\nepithelial cells in the fibrovascular cores. However, there are myoepithelial cells \\nat the periphery of the involved duct [77, 78].\\n•  Encapsulated Papillary Carcinoma (EPC)\\nThis lesion has a fibrous capsule, and its size ranges between 0.5 and 8\\xa0cm \\n[79]. It is also called intracystic papillary carcinoma. All papillary intraductal \\ncarcinomas arise in a background of a variably cystically dilated duct. EPC lacks \\nmyoepithelial cells both in the fibrovascular cores and at the periphery [78, 79]. \\nThe absence of these cells and reported cases of metastatic tumors raise the pos-\\nsibility that these tumors represent low-grade invasive carcinomas with an \\nexpansile growth pattern [80]. However, the presence of continuous and intense \\ncollagen IV expression at the periphery is considered highly suggestive of a non-\\ninvasive carcinoma that is confined within an intact basement membrane [80]. \\nEPC without an adjacent DCIS or any invasive component has a very favorable \\nprognosis with adequate local therapy. The presence of associated DCIS confers \\na higher risk of local recurrence.\\n•  Solid Papillary Carcinoma\\nSPC is a variant of papillary carcinoma that is characterized by compact cel-\\nlular growth within multiple nodules representing dilated ducts [55]. It presents \\nin older women [77]. SPC is homogenous and does not form papillary or cribri-\\nform patterns. Neuroendocrine differentiation is frequent. Mucin production is \\ncommon, and invasive mucinous carcinoma may coexist. Other types of invasive \\ncarcinoma may also be observed [81]. The distinction between in situ and inva-\\nsive disease in SPC is difficult. Some authors regard this entity to be an expansile \\nvariant of invasive carcinoma [81, 82]. SPC has an indolent clinical course, even \\nin cases with obvious invasion [81].\\nIn the papillary lesions mentioned above, the lesion is called in situ if there is \\nany doubt about the invasion. If there is obvious invasion, the staging should be \\nconducted according to the measurement of the invasive component [83].\\n•  Invasive Papillary Carcinoma\\nInvasive papillary carcinoma (IPC) is a carcinoma with a predominantly pap-\\nillary morphology in its “invasive” component. This is a rare lesion, and there are \\nno specific clinical and macroscopic features of this tumor. It should be distin-\\nguished from invasive carcinomas arising from EPC and SPC.\\xa0Many older series \\nmay have included such cases in this category [55].\\n3 Pathology of\\xa0Breast Cancer 145\\n Adenoid Cystic Carcinoma\\nACC is a carcinoma of low-grade malignant potential that is histologically simi-\\nlar to its counterpart in the salivary gland. This is a rare tumor. Approximately \\nhalf of the cases arise from the subareolar region [84]. ACC is usually a circum-\\nscribed tumor. Histologically, the tumor has the following basic patterns: tubular, \\ncribriform, trabecular, and solid [85]. The neoplastic cells, which are epithelial \\nand myoepithelial (basal), are arranged to form glandular spaces and pseudolu-\\nmina [24]. With occasional exceptions, ACC is triple negative [24]. Breast ACC \\nrarely involves the axillary lymph nodes, and survival is excellent [84, 86]. A \\nsolid variant with basaloid features has a higher frequency of axillary lymph \\nnode metastasis [87].\\n Glycogen–Rich Clear Cell Carcinoma\\nThis is a carcinoma in which 90% or more of the tumor cells have abundant clear \\ncytoplasm containing glycogen [2]. It accounts for 1–3% of breast carcinomas. The \\nclear or finely granular cytoplasm contains PAS-positive diastase-labile glycogen. \\nER is present in 50% of cases, and PR is absent [23]. This tumor should be distin-\\nguished from lipid-rich carcinoma, histiocytoid carcinoma, and metastatic renal cell \\ncarcinoma [24]. There are conflicting reports regarding the prognosis of these \\ntumors [88, 89].\\n Inflammatory Carcinoma\\nInflammatory carcinoma (IC) is an aggressive form of breast carcinoma with dis-\\ntinct clinical features. Clinically, there is rapid breast enlargement with edema and \\nerythema of the skin (orange peel skin). Currently, there are no definitive molecular \\nor pathological diagnostic criteria for IC.\\xa0Therefore, the diagnosis is based on the \\nclinical findings described above [90]. Signs and symptoms required for a diagnosis \\nof IC include erythema occupation of at least one-third of the breast, edema and/or \\npeau d’orange of the breast, and/or a warm breast, without an underlying palpable \\nmass in the majority of cases [90, 91]. IC is not considered a specific histological \\nsubtype of breast carcinoma, and there are no special pathological diagnostic crite-\\nria for IC [90, 91]. The underlying carcinoma is most often IDC NST of high grade; \\nthere may or may not be a distinct mass. The pathognomonic histopathological find-\\ning in IC is the presence of many lymphovascular tumor emboli in the papillary and \\nreticular dermis overlying the breast. Approximately 55% of cases are negative for \\nER and PR, 45% are HER2 positive, and 33% are triple negative [92]. Survival is \\nworse than in patients with locally advanced breast cancer without IC [2].\\n146 S. Tuzlali and E. Yavuz\\nMucoepidermoid carcinoma, polymorphous carcinoma, oncocytic carcinoma, \\nsebaceous carcinoma, lipid-rich carcinoma, and acinic cell carcinoma are very rare \\ntumors and beyond the scope of this chapter.\\nReferences\\n 1.

Fibroepithelial tumors are biphasic neoplasms character-\\nized by a proliferation of both epithelial and mesenchymal elements. Fibroadenoma \\nand phyllodes tumors constitute the major entities.\\n Mesenchymal Tumors of\\xa0the\\xa0Breast\\nBenign mesenchymal tumors that occur elsewhere in the body have been described in the \\nbreast, including lipoma, angiolipoma, leiomyoma, neurofibroma and schwannoma [1].\\nMalignant mesenchymal tumors of the breast other than angiosarcomas are extremely \\nrare. However, any type of sarcoma may occur in the breast as a primary lesion, includ-\\ning liposarcoma, leiomyosarcoma, rhabdomyosarcoma, malignant peripheral nerve \\nsheath tumor, and osteosarcoma [1]. Their histological features are similar to their coun-\\nterparts occurring elsewhere. A surgical pathologist is frequently confronted with the \\ndifficulty of differentiating these lesions from “metaplastic carcinoma of the breast” \\n(MBC) and “sarcomatous overgrowth in malignant phyllodes tumor” (MPT), which is \\nmore important than their subclassification as a primary sarcoma.\\nE.

Tuzlali\\nCases composed of malignant spindle cells without any morphological evidence \\nof epithelial differentiation are often challenging, even in surgical specimens [2]. In \\nthe absence of in situ carcinoma or small cohesive epithelial foci, the absence of \\nimmunohistochemical expression of epithelial differentiation markers and the \\nabsence of the characteristic leaf-like architecture of malignant phyllodes tumors \\nhelps rule out the diagnosis of MBC or MPT.\\xa0A primary sarcoma of the breast can \\nthen be diagnosed. Other entities such as malignant melanoma and metastatic sar-\\ncomatoid tumors should also be considered in differential diagnosis.\\n Nodular Fasciitis\\nNodular fasciitis ((NF) is a self-limited, mass-forming fibroblastic-myofibroblastic pro-\\nliferation that is clonal [1]. NF of the breast is a rare, rapidly growing lesion that may be \\npainful. Unexcised lesions regress spontaneously within a couple of months [3]. NF \\nmostly arises in the subcutis as a well-circumscribed nodule that may have cystic \\nchanges. Parenchymal involvement is less frequent. Microscopically, NF is a well-cir-\\ncumscribed proliferation of plump, spindle cells arranged in short fascicles. Mitoses are \\nusually frequent. Immunohistochemically, these cells are negative for keratin, CD34 and \\nS100 and typically positive for smooth muscle actin (SMA). Although these lesions \\nregress spontaneously, they are very frequently excised to obtain a definite diagnosis.\\nDifferential diagnosis: Fibromatosis, fibromatosis-like spindle cell metaplastic \\ncarcinoma and postoperative spindle cell nodules are the entities that should be \\nconsidered in differential diagnosis [4, 5].\\n Hemangioma\\nHemangioma is a benign proliferation of mature blood vessels [1]. Hemangiomas \\nmay arise in the skin and within the breast tissue. Hemangiomas of the breast paren-\\nchyma are incidental findings, and palpable and mammographic lesions are rare and \\nshould be distinguished from angiosarcomas [6].\\nMicroscopic minute hemangiomas that are smaller than 2\\xa0mm can be located \\nanywhere in the breast stroma and are called “perilobular hemangioma” [7, 8].\\nThe importance of these lesions is that they should be distinguished from well- \\ndifferentiated angiosarcomas.\\n Atypical Vascular Lesions\\nAtypical vascular lesion (AVL) is a term that refers to a continuum of cutaneous \\nlesions that have some but not all features of angiosarcoma [9]. These angioforma-\\ntive proliferations develop in the skin of patients with a history of breast-conserving \\n4 Mesenchymal and\\xa0Fibroepithelial Tumors of\\xa0the\\xa0Breast 153\\nsurgery and radiation therapy. The lesions develop within the radiation field \\n1–12\\xa0years (median 6.0\\xa0years) after therapy [9]. AVLs present as one or more flesh- \\ncolored, brown or erythematous patches and papules ranging from 0.1 to 6\\xa0cm [1, \\n10] but are generally less than 1\\xa0cm.\\nAVLs can be categorized as lymphatic and vascular types.\\nRecent studies have shown that MYC expression is detected by IHC and/or gene \\namplification is detected by FISH in 54–100% of secondary angiosarcomas, in con-\\ntrast to AVL and primary angiosarcomas of the breast [11, 12].\\nRecurrent or additional AVLs may occur. In a series of 30 patients from the \\nEuropean Institute of Oncology, Milan, the lesion showed benign behavior in 93.3%, \\none patient developed local recurrence of AVL, and two patients progressed to angio-\\nsarcoma at the previous AVL site. Venous-type AVLs were found to have a higher risk \\nof progression to AS compared to the lymphatic-type lesions [12]. Further studies are \\nneeded to better understand the clinical behavior of AVLs. Complete excision with \\nfree surgical margins and close follow-up is recommended [12].\\n Angiosarcoma\\nThese tumors can be subdivided as follows [1]:\\n 1. Primary (de novo): Arising in the breast parenchyma.\\n 2. Secondary: Developing in the skin, chest wall or breast parenchyma subsequent \\nto surgery and postoperative radiation for breast cancer.\\nPrimary angiosarcomas are located deep in the breast parenchyma as a mass \\naveraging 5–7\\xa0cm. Skin involvement causes a bluish-red discoloration on the over-\\nlying skin. They are ill-defined lesions with a spongy appearance.\\nLow-grade (Grade I) (well-differentiated) tumors are characterized by inter- \\nanastomosing and dissecting vascular channels that are filled with erythrocytes. \\nThey often involve and disrupt the breast ducts and lobules. The endothelial cells \\nshow nuclear hyperchromasia. Mitoses are scarce, and necrosis and papillary and \\nsolid areas are absent. The lesions have a benign-looking appearance and are often \\nmultifocal.\\nIntermediate-grade (Grade II) lesions have focally increased cellularity, and \\nthese solid areas are scattered throughout the tumor [6]. There is endothelial tufting, \\nwhich is not a feature of grade I tumors (Figs.\\xa04.1 and 4.2).\\nHigh-grade (Grade III) (poorly differentiated) angiosarcomas are easily recog-\\nnized by the presence of solid spindle cell areas with a high mitotic index. Necrosis \\nand hemorrhage are frequent.\\nCD31 and CD34 are used to prove endothelial differentiation in these tumors. \\nHigh histological grade and early metastasis (within 12\\xa0months after diagnosis) are \\nassociated with poor prognosis [13]. However, a large series of 49 cases revealed \\nthat grade had no prognostic effect in primary angiosarcomas of the breast, and the \\nrisk of metastasis is at least 50% in tumors of any grade [14]. Radiation therapy is \\nineffective, and chemotherapy is of little benefit. Mastectomy is the treatment of \\n154 E. Yavuz and S. Tuzlali\\nFig. 4.1 Angiosarcoma. \\nInteranastomosing vascular \\nchannels lined by atypical \\ncells\\nFig. 4.2 Vascular channels \\nwith endothelial tufting\\nchoice, irrespective of grade. The most common sites of metastases are the lung, \\nliver, bone, skin. At presentation, the contralateral breast has metastatic deposits in \\n21% of cases [15].\\n Fibromatosis\\nFibromatosis is a clonal proliferation of fibroblasts/myofibroblasts that has a pro-\\npensity for local recurrence. These lesions are categorized as extra-abdominal deep \\nfibromatoses (desmoids). They frequently arise from the connective tissue of the \\npectoralis muscle or the overlying fascia [6]. Primary fibromatosis of the breast is \\nuncommon. The age range for primary fibromatosis is 13–80\\xa0years, but it most com-\\nmonly affects females in the third to fifth decades. Sporadic cases may appear after \\n4 Mesenchymal and\\xa0Fibroepithelial Tumors of\\xa0the\\xa0Breast 155\\ntrauma or augmentation with implants. It may also occur as part of familial adeno-\\nmatous polyposis (FAP) or hereditary desmoid syndrome and Gardner’s \\nsyndrome.\\nThe size of the lesion varies from 0.7 to 10\\xa0cm, with an average size of 2.5\\xa0cm, \\nwhich is notably smaller than other extra-abdominal desmoid tumors [6, 16, 17]. \\nGrossly, the lesion presents as an ill-defined, firm nodule, but cases with a stellate \\nappearance are not rare [6]. Clinical suspicion for carcinoma is common.\\nThe lesion is composed of elongated, spindle cells with a bland appearance, which \\nform long sweeping fascicles. Entrapped parenchymal elements are usually seen at the \\nperiphery of the lesion. The mitotic rate is variable but usually low. The amount of col-\\nlagen and the cellularity of the lesion vary considerably. A zoning phenomenon with a \\ntendency for central hyalinization and increased cellularity at the periphery is observed.\\nThe spindle cells stain for vimentin and smooth muscle actin. Desmin and S-100 \\npositivity are observed in a small percentage of cases. Nuclear positivity for beta \\ncatenin, which is observed in 70–75% of the lesions, is supportive but not definitive \\nfor diagnosis. Beta catenin positivity is observed in other myofibroblastic tumors, \\nsuch as solitary fibrous tumors [18].\\nDifferential diagnosis: Scars, nodular fasciitis, sarcomas and fibromatosis-like \\nmetaplastic breast carcinomas.\\nRecurrences are observed in up to 27% of cases [17], especially in cases with inade-\\nquate excision margins [19]. Wide local excision is recommended for treating these cases.\\n Myofibroblastoma\\nMyofibroblastoma of the breast is an uncommon, benign, nonrecurring tumor. It \\noccurs over a wide age range (25–78) but most often in the sixth to eighth decades \\n[20]. The frequency of occurrence is equal in both sexes [20]. It presents as a soli-\\ntary, mobile, slow-growing lesion with an average diameter of 2\\xa0cm [20–22].\\nThe proliferating spindle cells are arranged in short fascicles that are separated \\nby hyalinized collagen bands. In a classical case, the lesion is well-circumscribed, \\nand the compressed breast parenchyma forms a pseudocapsule. Occasionally, the \\nmargins of the lesion are infiltrative. Mast cells are always present. There is little or \\nno nuclear pleomorphism. Mitoses are infrequent [20–22].\\nIn the majority of these lesions, the spindle cells are positive for desmin and \\nCD34. Positivity for smooth muscle actin is variable.\\n Inflammatory Myofibroblastic Tumor\\nInflammatory myofibroblastic tumor (IMT) is a low-grade neoplasm consisting of \\nmyofibroblastic spindle cells mixed with prominent inflammatory cells, usually \\nplasma cells. IMT is very rare in the breast [1].\\n156 E. Yavuz and S. Tuzlali\\nIMT in the breast presents as a painless, circumscribed firm mass. The majority \\nof lesions are benign with a local recurrence rate of 10–25%. Fewer than 5% of \\ncases of IMT arising at any site metastasize, and metastasis from IMT arising in the \\nbreast has not been reported [1].\\n Granular Cell Tumor\\nGranular cell tumors (GCTs) are tumors with eosinophilic cytoplasm derived from \\nSchwann cells of peripheral nerves. They may simulate an invasive carcinoma clini-\\ncally, radiologically and microscopically. They can cause skin dimpling or nipple \\nretraction. They are usually unifocal lesions. Grossly, they usually present as a well- \\ncircumscribed mass [1]. Microscopically they have an infiltrative growth pattern with \\nsheets, nests and clusters of round to polygonal cells. The cells have PAS-p ositive dia-\\nstase-resistant granules in their cytoplasm and strong and diffuse positivity for S-100 \\nprotein and CD68. Patients with GCT are treated by wide local excision. The tumor has \\nlittle long-term risk for recurrence, even when excised with positive margins [23].\\nA large tumor size (over 5\\xa0cm), pleomorphism, increased mitotic activity and \\npresence of necrosis are features suggestive of malignancy [1].\\n Pseudoangiomatous Stromal Hyperplasia\\nPseudoangiomatous stromal hyperplasia (PASH) is a benign myofibroblastic prolif-\\neration with the appearance of anastomosing slit-like spaces lined by spindle-shaped \\ncells [1]. It occurs most commonly in premenopausal women.\\nThe widely accepted hypothesis is that the stromal hyperplasia in PASH results \\nfrom an exaggerated, aberrant response of mammary myofibroblasts to endogenous \\nor exogenous hormonal stimuli. The main hormone implicated in stimulating the \\nmyofibroblasts is progesterone [24]. PASH can occur as an isolated mass or may \\ncoexist with any breast lesion ranging from benign to malignant. When it presents \\nas a palpable mass and a radiological lesion mimicking fibroadenoma, the term \\n“tumorous or nodular PASH” is used.\\nThe size of tumorous PASH ranges from 0.6 to 12\\xa0cm. Gross examination reveals \\na well-circumscribed, round or oval, non-encapsulated, rubbery, homogenous, lobu-\\nlated nodular mass.\\nMicroscopically, PASH is characterized by complex anastomosing, slit-like \\nspaces in a dense fibrous stroma. These spaces are lined by a layer of flat, benign \\nspindle cells resembling endothelial cells. Mitosis or nuclear atypia is lacking \\n(Fig.\\xa04.3). The stromal hyperplasia may involve perilobular and intralobular stroma. \\nRarely, the proliferating myofibroblasts form bundles and fascicles in a background \\nof conventional PASH, which may pose diagnostic difficulty.\\nMyofibroblasts of PASH are positive for CD34 and progesterone receptor with \\nvariable staining for smooth muscle actin and desmin [2]. They are negative for \\nendothelial cell markers, cytokeratin, and S100.\\n4 Mesenchymal and\\xa0Fibroepithelial Tumors of\\xa0the\\xa0Breast 157\\nFig. 4.3 Pseudoangiomatous \\nstromal hyperplasia (PASH). \\nSlit-like spaces lined by a \\nlayer of flat, benign spindle \\ncells resembling endothelial \\ncells in continuous with the \\nbreast lobule in the right\\nThe differential diagnoses of PASH include low-grade angiosarcoma and myofi-\\nbroblastoma. Angiosarcoma is an infiltrative lesion and has positive staining with \\nendothelial cell markers. The fascicular form of PASH may be difficult to distin-\\nguish from myofibroblastoma, which is believed to have a common histogenetic \\norigin with PASH.\\xa0Vimentin, CD34 and actin are positive in both lesions. The pres-\\nence of more typical areas of PASH, positivity for progesterone receptor in PASH, \\nand positivity for androgen receptor in myofibroblastoma are helpful clues in the \\ndifferential diagnosis of these lesions.\\nPASH is a benign lesion that is adequately treated by local excision, although \\nrates of recurrence varying from 13% to 26% have been reported. Recurrence is \\nmore likely if the lesion is not completely excised [1, 25].\\n Fibroepithelial Tumors\\nFibroepithelial tumors are biphasic neoplasms characterized by the proliferation of \\nboth epithelial and mesenchymal elements. Fibroadenoma and phyllodes tumors \\nconstitute the major entities.\\n Fibroadenoma\\nFibroadenoma is a very common benign breast tumor occurring in women of child- \\nbearing age, i.e., 20–30\\xa0years of age, but it may be encountered at any age [1]. It is \\nthe most common lesion among women younger than 25\\xa0 years of age [6]. \\nFibroadenomas originate from the terminal duct lobular unit [26].\\nFibroadenomas typically present as a slow-growing, well-circumscribed, firm, \\npainless, mobile mass that is generally less than 3\\xa0cm in size. Less frequently, par-\\nticularly for the juvenile variant, they may present as a very large mass. The cut \\n158 E. Yavuz and S. Tuzlali\\nFig. 4.4 Fibroadenoma \\nintracanalicular type\\nsurface is gray-white, solid, and rubbery with a lobulated appearance and slit-like \\nspaces [1, 27].\\nIt is believed that fibroadenomas develop as a result of unopposed estrogenic \\ninfluences [6].\\nMicroscopically, fibroadenomas consist of an admixture of stromal and epithe-\\nlial elements. Two growth patterns are recognized:\\n• The intracanalicular pattern is characterized by the proliferation of stromal cells \\naround compressed ducts that resemble clefts (Fig.\\xa04.4).\\n• The pericanalicular pattern is characterized by the proliferation of stroma around \\nglandular structures with open lumina that resemble tubules.\\nThese patterns often coexist and are thought to have no clinical significance.\\nThe epithelial and mesenchymal elements may undergo some metaplastic and pro-\\nliferative changes. Stroma may occasionally exhibit focal or diffuse cellularity, exten-\\nsive myxoid changes, hyalinization with dystrophic calcification or even ossification.\\nLipomatous, smooth muscle and osteochondromatous metaplasia may occur in \\nfibroadenomas.\\nFibroadenomas that have cystic spaces, sclerosing adenosis, and apocrine hyper-\\nplasia are called “complex fibroadenomas”.\\nFibroadenomas with a prominent cellular stroma are called “cellular \\nfibroadenomas”.\\n“Juvenile fibroadenomas” are characterized by stromal hypercellularity and epithelial \\nhyperplasia. They are most commonly seen in patients younger than 20\\xa0years of age [27].\\n Phyllodes Tumor\\nPhyllodes tumors (PTs) are regarded as deriving de novo from periductal and spe-\\ncialized lobular stroma.\\n4 Mesenchymal and\\xa0Fibroepithelial Tumors of\\xa0the\\xa0Breast 159\\nThey may occur at any age, with a median age of approximately 45, approxi-\\nmately 20\\xa0years older than the median age of fibroadenomas [27]. There are no \\nspecific clinical features that distinguish these tumors from fibroadenomas. \\nHowever, in the presence of a history of rapid growth, diagnosis of PT may be \\nfavored [27].\\nThe classical histological appearance has two features:\\n– an exaggerated intracanalicular pattern with leaf-like fronds protruding into cys-\\ntically dilated spaces;\\n– stromal hypercellularity.\\nPTs are classified as benign, borderline and malignant on the basis of some path-\\nological features [1].\\nThe distinction between benign PT and cellular FA is problematic in core needle \\nbiopsies. However, definitive distinction between them may not be crucial in light \\nof the similar reported recurrence rates.\\nPT Versus Cellular FA Benign PT shows mildly increased stromal cellularity \\ncompared with fibroadenomas, has minimal nuclear atypia, pushing borders, and \\nmitoses in less than five mitotic figures per ten high-power fields (HPFs). Stromal \\novergrowth is not present [28].\\nMalignant PT A fibroepithelial lesion is called malignant PT when there are \\nmarked stromal hypercellularity, nuclear atypia, increased mitoses in more than ten \\nmitotic figures per ten HPFs, permeative tumor borders, and stromal overgrowth \\nthat can be easily identified. The presence of a malignant heterologous component \\nsuch as liposarcoma or chondrosarcoma places the tumor in the malignant category \\nregardless of other histological features [28].\\nBorderline PT Phyllodes tumors with intermediate features are categorized as \\nborderline PT.\\nA practical approach is to grade a phyllodes tumor as malignant when it shows \\nall histological changes of malignancy and as borderline when not all malignant \\ncharacteristics are present [28].\\nThe problem in these lesions is that the degrees of stromal cellularity and cellular \\natypia are subjective. The issue becomes more problematic in an individual case \\nwhen intratumoral heterogeneity is present, which is not an uncommon finding in \\nPTs.\\nFrom a clinical standpoint, we may state the following:\\n• Benign PTs have the potential to recur.\\n• Borderline PTs have the potential to recur, with a very low risk of metastasis.\\n• Malignant PTs have the highest risk of metastatic behavior, which may eventu-\\nally prove fatal.\\n• Malignant PTs are associated with a recurrence rate of 29.6% [29], with metas-\\ntasis and death observed in 22% [1] of cases.\\n160 E. Yavuz and S. Tuzlali\\nAlthough the literature often refers to a margin width of at least 10\\xa0mm, a robust \\nevidence base to support this approach is lacking. Therefore, an ideal margin width \\nremains to be determined and may need to be considered in relation to factors such \\nas tumor size and cosmesis. Axillary dissection is not recommended because of the \\nrarity of lymph node metastasis [28].\\nA multivariate analysis study revealed that stromal nuclear atypia, stromal over-\\ngrowth and status of surgical margins are independent predictive parameters of \\nclinical behavior [29].\\nReferences\\n 1.

Depending on the pathologist’s \\nexperience and conditions, the method is usually either frozen section (FS) or cytol-\\nogy in addition to gross examination, although some molecular techniques have \\nrecently been developed for IPE.\\n Intraoperative Pathological Diagnosis of\\xa0Breast Lesions\\nAlthough FS may be used for the rapid diagnosis of breast lesions in the operating \\nroom with high accuracy, specificity, and sensitivity [1, 2], it is rarely performed \\nbecause the majority of breast malignancies are diagnosed with preoperative core or \\nfine needle aspiration biopsies. Nevertheless, rapid FS diagnosis is subject to certain \\nrequirements. A possibly benign or grossly undetectable lesion or a lesion smaller than \\n1\\xa0cm is not appropriate for rapid FS diagnosis. Because rapid FS diagnosis is rarely \\nrequested, pathologists should be aware of the potential pitfalls, including benign \\nlesions mimicking malignancy or vice versa. Although a correct intraoperative \\nE. Yavuz \\nIstanbul University, Istanbul Medical Faculty, Department of Pathology, Istanbul, Turkey\\ne-mail: yavuze@istanbul.edu.tr \\nS.

Tuzlali\\ndiagnosis should be reached by using only gross examination and cytology [3–5], \\nmany pathologists are reluctant to use only cytological methods in the operating room.\\n Intraoperative Pathological Assessment of\\xa0Surgical Margins\\nThe most important parameter for local recurrence after breast-conserving surgery \\n(BCS) for the treatment of breast cancer is surgical margin negativity [6]. Hence, \\nintraoperative assessment of the surgical margins (IASM) of breast excisions is usu-\\nally requested. However, many factors can decrease the accuracy of IASM.\\xa0Adipose \\ntissue may be easily broken off during surgery, causing defects on the surface of the \\nexcision. The excised tissue may flatten after removal (pancake phenomenon), thus \\ndecreasing the distance between the tumor and the margin [7].\\nThe success of IASM is also related to collaboration between surgeons and \\npathologists. The surgeon should inform the pathologist about the size, extent, and \\nnumber of possibly malignant breast lesions and should send an intact specimen \\nbearing orientation sutures. First, the pathologist should stain the surface of the \\nspecimen with India ink or another stain that is resistant to solutions used in pro-\\ncessing. After slicing the specimen to a thickness of 0.5\\xa0cm, the distances to all \\nsurgical margins can be detected grossly. However, there may be microscopic satel-\\nlite foci of invasive or in situ carcinoma around the gross tumor, and the true dis-\\ntance to the margin may be smaller than expected. Hence, FS may be performed if \\na tumor is close to the margin grossly (Figs.\\xa05.1 and 5.2). FS may be performed \\nusing samples taken either perpendicular or parallel to the surface of the specimen. \\nWe prefer to take perpendicular samples to accurately detect the true distance. If \\nparallel (en face) sections are used and no tumor is detected in microscopic exami-\\nnation of FS, than at least a 2-mm-free distance between the tumor and the margin \\nFig. 5.1 Frozen section \\nappearance of an invasive \\nbreast cancer. This section \\nshows that the distance to \\nthe surgical margin is \\nnearly 0.5\\xa0mm, although \\nthe fatty part of the \\ntumor-free tissue could not \\nobserved due to the \\nlimitation of frozen \\nsectioning (HE ×10 \\noriginal magnification)\\n5 Intraoperative Pathological Examination of\\xa0Breast Lesions 165\\nFig. 5.2 The gross \\nappearance of frozen \\nsectioned tissue may also \\nfacilitate margin \\nassessment because \\nfreezing usually highlights \\nthe tumor\\nmay be anticipated. Some surgeons may perform re-excisions by shaving the cavity, \\nand these re-excisions may be analyzed by FS as well [8, 9].\\nEven if immediate cavity margin shaving is performed after a lumpectomy with \\ntumor-free margins, there may still exist microscopic foci of carcinoma in the breast \\nat rates ranging from 9% to 39% [10, 11]. Invasive lobular carcinomas (Fig.\\xa05.3) and \\ninvasive carcinomas with an extensive intraductal component and extensive lym-\\nphovascular invasion are more likely to show multifocality and result in false- \\nnegative margins. The impact of FS on margin assessment has been demonstrated in \\nretrospective analyses, which reported immediate re-excision in 24–27% of cases \\nand second re-excision due to definitive histopathological examination in 5–9% of \\ncases [12–14].\\nMargin status may also be assessed using cytology intraoperatively. Although \\nsome authors have reported high rates of specificity and sensitivity of cytological \\nmethods in IASM [15, 16], experience with this method in breast cytology is \\nrequired. Furthermore, success rates would decrease in cancers with low nuclear \\ngrade, such as invasive lobular carcinoma [17].\\nThere are also methods for IASM that do not require microscopy, including \\nintraoperative ultrasonography, specimen radiography for lesions with microcalcifi-\\ncations, and physical methods such as radiofrequency spectroscopy, optical coher-\\nence tomography, Raman spectroscopy, diffuse reflectance imaging, and \\nmultispectral photoacoustic tomography. The emerging physical methods need to \\ncompete with the diagnostic accuracy of existing techniques while offering advan-\\ntages in terms of speed, cost, and reliability [18].\\nWhen reporting margin status, “positive” should be stated if tumor cells were \\ndetected on the inked surface; otherwise, the distance to the margin should be given. \\nWe do not recommend using the term “close to margin” due to its ambiguity.\\n166 E. Yavuz and S. Tuzlali\\nFig. 5.3 A microscopic \\nsatellite focus in a case of \\ninvasive lobular carcinoma \\nreveals that the surgical \\nmargin is closer than \\ngrossly expected (HE ×10 \\noriginal magnification)\\n Pathological Examination of\\xa0Sentinel Lymph Nodes\\n Intraoperative Pathological Examination of\\xa0Sentinel Lymph \\nNodes\\nThe frequency of intraoperative examination of sentinel lymph nodes (SLN) in \\nbreast cancer patients who will undergo BCS and radiotherapy has decreased since \\na randomized study showed that completion of axillary lymph node dissection was \\nnot superior to SLN biopsy alone regarding disease-free and overall survival [19, \\n20]. However, there are some clinical settings in which the pathologist will continue \\nto perform intraoperative SLN examination.\\nIntraoperative pathological examination of SLN may be performed using either \\nFS or cytological methods. Each method has some advantages and disadvantages. \\nImprint or scrape cytology is easy, rapid and preserves the tissue for subsequent \\nparaffin-block examination. However, it requires experience, and the detected \\nmetastasis cannot be measured properly. The use of both methods has been found to \\nbe satisfactory in some meta-analyses. However, the use of both methods \\n intraoperatively would not increase the success rate of detecting micrometastases \\n(MIM) [21, 22].\\nIntraoperative rapid immunohistochemistry with cytokeratin and molecular tech-\\nniques such as one-step nucleic acid amplification (OSNA) have shown satisfactory \\nresults in accurately detecting even MIMs [23, 24]. However, the American Society \\nof Clinical Oncology has recommended that molecular techniques in intraoperative \\nSLN examination remain investigational and that tissue for permanent pathological \\nexamination be preserved [25].\\n5 Intraoperative Pathological Examination of\\xa0Breast Lesions 167\\n Permanent Pathological Analysis of\\xa0Sentinel Lymph Nodes\\n Gross Examination\\nAll SLNs should be measured and sliced in 2-mm thicknesses after dissection of \\nfatty tissue. The slicing may be either in the longitudinal or transverse direction. If \\na dye was used in the surgical procedure, the afferent lymphatic can be observed. \\nPathological examination may be more successful if the section can be made where \\nthe afferent lymphatic is connected to the SLN.\\xa0Partial involvement of the SLN by \\nthe metastatic tumor can be easily observed in the surface of the slice based on the \\nsharp contrast between the tumor and lymphoid tissue. However, permeative metas-\\ntases may be difficult to observe grossly.\\n Sectioning\\nThe majority of metastases can easily be detected with standard examination of \\nHE-stained slides [26, 27]. Superficial serial sectioning, which limits the observa-\\ntion to the upper parts of the tissue in the paraffin block, enables the detection of all \\nmacrometastases (MAM) [28, 29]. However, the majority of even MIMs can be \\ndetected if multiple-step serial sectioning is performed [30–32]. Furthermore, if the \\nstep serial sectioning is performed at 0.2-mm intervals, all MIMs can be detected \\n[33], but an excessive number of slides will be generated.\\n Use of\\xa0Immunohistochemistry\\nThe use of immunohistochemistry to evaluate SLNs is not recommended by major \\norganizations [26, 34, 35]. However, immunostaining with antibodies against cyto-\\nkeratin is very helpful in the detection of dyscohesive cells of invasive lobular car-\\ncinoma that are dispersed through the sinuses of SLNs (Fig.\\xa05.4).\\n Histopathology\\nMAMs usually replace the lymphoid tissue and can easily be observed. Lobular \\ncarcinomas may diffusely infiltrate the lymph node parenchyma with isolated cells \\nor small clusters. MAM is the term used for a metastasis measuring more than \\n2\\xa0mm. “Isolated tumor cells/submicrometastasis” (ITC) is the term used for a meta-\\nstatic focus measuring less than 0.2\\xa0mm. Another definition for ITC that is essential \\nfor lobular carcinoma is less than 200 neoplastic cells in a cross section of the \\n168 E. Yavuz and S.

MIMs and ITCs are usually detected in subcapsular sinuses of the SLN, \\nand careful observation of these sites is crucial. Differential diagnosis of MIMs \\nincludes MAMs and ITCs and should be made according to the abovementioned \\nmeasurements. Multiple MIMs can be detected and should not be diagnosed as a \\nMAM.\\xa0Other lesions included in the differential diagnosis of MIMs are mechanical \\ntransportation of breast epithelium, nevus cell aggregates, benign epithelial inclu-\\nsions (Fig.\\xa05.5), and extramedullary hematopoiesis; differential diagnosis of these \\nlesions usually necessitates experience in this field and immunohistochemical \\ntechniques.\\n5 Intraoperative Pathological Examination of\\xa0Breast Lesions 169\\nReferences\\n 1.

These parameters include tumor size, \\naxillary lymph node status, histological features (especially histological type, grade \\nand lymphovascular invasion), hormone receptor status, HER2 status and prolifera-\\ntive capacity of the tumor. Considering these factors in combination is of greater \\nclinical value than viewing each in isolation, and the combined approach forms the \\nbasis of a number of schema used to group patients into various risk categories, such \\nas the St Gallen criteria, the NIH consensus criteria, the Nottingham Prognostic \\nIndex, and Adjuvant!

Yavuz\\n Tumor Size\\nFor the maximum correlation with prognosis, the size of tumors should only be \\nassessed on pathological specimens because clinical evaluation is inaccurate. Tumor \\nsize should ideally be measured before fixation and confirmed microscopically. \\nMany studies have shown that patients with smaller tumors have better long-term \\nsurvival than do those with larger tumors [3–6]. Tumor size is based on the size of \\nthe invasive component of the tumor [7, 8]. In cases with an accompanying in situ \\ncomponent, the in situ area that is outside the invasive tumor is not included in the \\ntumor size ‘T’. However, if the in situ component is intermingled with the invasive \\nareas, T will include these in situ areas. If there are multiple areas of invasion, the \\nsize of the largest invasive carcinoma is used in the T staging. Occasionally, multi-\\nple invasive foci occur in close proximity to each other, creating difficulty in deter-\\nmining the invasive tumor size. Correlation of radiological and gross findings with \\nthe microscopic appearance may be necessary. The choice of T staging may depend \\non the pathologist’s own judgement. In cases when the tumor is transected by a \\nprevious biopsy, the sizes of the tumors in the separate specimens should not be \\nadded, and an estimation should be performed with the aid of imaging studies [8].\\n Lymph Node Status\\nThe status of the axillary lymph nodes is the most important single prognostic param-\\neter in breast carcinomas. Lymph node staging should be based on histological evalu-\\nation of the excised lymph nodes since clinical evaluation is not sufficient for an \\naccurate staging. Numerous studies have shown that patients with histologically con-\\nfirmed axillary lymph node involvement have a significantly poorer prognosis than \\nthose without nodal involvement. The extent of axillary invasion by level also has \\nstrong prognostic significance, and the involvement of higher levels of the axilla has a \\nworse prognosis [9]. Surgical removal of positive nodes does not appear to have a \\nmajor role in survival but is required for accurate staging and local control [10].\\nSentinel lymph node biopsy and the importance of low-volume metastases are \\ndescribed in detail in other chapters.\\nAlthough basal-like carcinomas belong to a poor prognostic group, they are the \\nleast likely to exhibit extensive nodal involvement. For these patients, other prog-\\nnostic markers will be more important than nodal staging [7]\\n Grading\\nThe Nottingham (Elston-Ellis) modification of the Scarff-Bloom-Richardson grad-\\ning system, also known as the Nottingham Grading System (NGS) [11], is the grad-\\ning system recommended by various professional organizations, such as the World \\n6 Prognostic and\\xa0Predictive Factors 173\\nHealth Organization [7], American Joint Committee on Cancer [AJCC], the Royal \\nCollege of Pathologists (UK RCPath), and College of American Pathologists (CAP) \\n[8]. NGS provides a simple, inexpensive, and routinely applicable overview of the \\nintrinsic biological characteristics and clinical behavior of tumors [12]. In NGS, the \\nsubjectivity of previous grading systems is reduced by strict definitions of the evalu-\\nation criteria.\\nMultiple independent studies have shown that NGS has prognostic value that is \\nequivalent to that of LN status and greater than that of tumor size [12, 13].\\nNGS refers to the semi-quantitative evaluation of some morphological character-\\nistics on an adequately prepared hematoxylin-eosin-stained tumor tissue section. \\nThis assessment should be performed by an appropriately trained pathologist using \\na standard protocol.\\nNGS is based on the evaluation of three morphological features [7, 11, 14]:\\n (a) degree of tubule or gland formation,\\n (b) nuclear pleomorphism, and\\n (c) mitotic count (found in 10 consecutive high-power fields (HPFs) in the most \\nmitotically active part of the tumor).\\nFeature Score\\nTubule formation\\nMajority of tumor (>75%) 1\\nModerate degree (10–75%) 2\\nLittle or none (<10%) 3\\nNuclear pleomorphism\\nSmall, regular uniform cells 1\\nModerate increase in size and variability 2\\nMarked variation 3\\nMitotic counts\\nDependent on microscope field area 1–3\\nFinal grading\\nAdd scores for tubule formation, nuclear pleomorphism and \\nmitotic count\\nGrade 1—well differentiated 3–5 points\\nGrade 2—moderately differentiated 6–7 points\\nGrade 3—poorly differentiated 8–9 points\\nHistological grade has been incorporated in multiple, validated, prognostic algo-\\nrithms to determine breast cancer therapy, such as the Nottingham Prognostic Index \\nand Adjuvant! Online.\\nAlthough grade identifies prognostic subgroups among special types of breast \\ncancer, medullary carcinomas, which are, by definition, of high histological grade, \\nhave a relatively good prognosis. This favorable prognosis may be related to the \\nprominent lymphoplasmacytic infiltrate in the tumor stroma [7].\\n174 S. Tuzlali and E. Yavuz\\n Histological Type\\nThe favorable prognosis of certain histological types of invasive carcinoma of the \\nbreast is well established. Tubular carcinoma, mucinous carcinoma, and invasive \\ncribriform carcinoma have all been reported to have a favorable prognosis [15]. \\nOther special types of breast cancer carrying an unfavorable prognosis are meta-\\nplastic carcinomas and invasive micropapillary carcinomas.\\n Lymphovascular Invasion\\nLymphovascular invasion (LVI) is the finding of carcinoma in the small vessels \\noutside the main tumor mass. It is strongly associated with lymph node status and is \\nalso an independent prognostic indicator of both local and distant recurrences and \\nsurvival [16, 17]. The presence of both LVI and nodal metastases confers a worse \\nprognosis than either alone [7].\\nTumor emboli are usually identified within thin-walled vascular channels. It is \\nnot possible to determine whether these spaces are lymphatic, capillaries or venules, \\nand the broad term ‘lymphovascular invasion’ is used.\\nVascular invasion should only be assessed in the breast tissue surrounding the \\ntumor and not within the tumor. The most common area to find LVI is within 0.1\\xa0cm \\nof the edge of the carcinoma.\\nSuboptimal fixation is the major reason for misinterpretation of both ductal car-\\ncinoma in situ and shrinkage artifacts as LVI. With optimal fixation, processing and \\nsectioning, LVI can be reliably identified in hematoxylin and eosin sections. \\nImmunohistochemistry is not necessary.\\n Hormone Receptors\\nThe estrogen receptor (ER) is a nuclear transcription factor that is a regulator of \\ncellular growth, proliferation, and differentiation in the breast epithelium. In addi-\\ntion to its prognostic value, ER is the most important biological marker of clinical \\nresponse to hormonal therapies such as tamoxifen. The progesterone receptor (PR) \\nis an estrogen-regulated gene, and its expression therefore indicates a functioning \\nER pathway.\\nThe best response is seen in patients whose tumors express both ER and PR [18]. \\nImmunohistochemical determination of these receptors is the standard tool in cur-\\nrent pathology-oncology practice. By immunohistochemistry (IHC), nuclear \\nexpression of ER protein is detected in approximately 80% of breast cancers \\n(Fig.\\xa06.1). Approximately 40% of ER-positive tumors are PR-negative. A lack of PR \\nexpression in ER-positive tumors may be a surrogate marker of aberrant growth \\nfactor signaling that could contribute to tamoxifen resistance [19].\\n6 Prognostic and\\xa0Predictive Factors 175\\nFig. 6.1 Immunohistochemical \\ndetermination of estrogen \\nreceptor in breast cancer. The \\nbrown- stained nuclei are \\npositive for estrogen receptor. \\nThe other nuclei with bluish \\nstaining lack estrogen receptor\\nA cutoff of 1% of tumor cells is recommended for a specimen to be considered \\npositive for ER/PR because clinical data have indicated that these patients can \\nrespond to hormonal treatment [20].\\nASCO/CAP guidelines recommend the use of only 10% neutral buffered forma-\\nlin as the fixative for breast cancer specimens. The fixation time should not be less \\nthan 6\\xa0h and not more than 72\\xa0h before processing [20, 21].\\nAll tumor-containing areas on a given slide should be evaluated, and the percent-\\nage of tumor cells with positive staining should be recorded and reported. Only \\nnuclear staining is considered positive. The intensity of staining is also recorded as \\nweak, moderate, or strong; this measurement represents an estimate of the average \\nstaining intensity of the positively stained tumor cells in comparison with the posi-\\ntive control section [20].\\nValidated antibodies demonstrating good correlation with patient outcomes in \\npublished reports should be chosen for accurate results. The ASCO/CAP panel rec-\\nommends [20] clones 1D5, 6F11, SP1, and 1D5\\xa0+\\xa0ER.2.123 (cocktail) for ER and \\nclones 1294, 312 and 1A6 for PR.\\n HER2\\nThe HER2 (ERBB2) gene is located on chromosome 17 and encodes the protein \\np185, which is a growth factor receptor on the surface of normal breast epithelium. \\nStudies have revealed that this gene is amplified in approximately 15–20% of breast \\ncancers with consequent elevation of protein expression. Overexpression of HER2 \\nis associated with aggressive histological features and poor prognosis.\\nMore important is the use of the HER2/neu oncoprotein as a target for ther-\\napy. Trastuzumab (Herceptin) is a humanized monoclonal antibody that targets \\nthe extracellular domain of the HER2 receptor. Several randomized clinical \\n trials have demonstrated substantial survival benefits in patients with \\n176 S. Tuzlali and E. Yavuz\\n HER2-positive breast cancer treated with anti-HER2 targeted therapy, such as \\ntrastuzumab [22].\\nThe most commonly used methods to evaluate HER2/neu in breast cancer are \\nIHC and in situ hybridization (ISH). ISH determines the number of HER2 copies \\nusing a DNA probe coupled to a fluorescent (FISH), chromogenic (CISH) or silver \\n(SISH) detection system.\\nIn clinical practice, accurate assessment of HER2 is essential in selecting patients \\nthat are candidates for anti-HER2 treatment. Relatively low and unacceptable concor-\\ndance rates between local and central laboratories in determining the presence of \\nHER2 protein necessitated the refinement of test performance parameters [23]. The \\ninterpretation of equivocal immunohistochemistry and borderline FISH cases is dif-\\nficult even for highly experienced and validated laboratories [24]. This difficulty is \\nalso one of the major reasons for the need for quality-control procedures. Many trials \\nhave also revealed that there is significant variation in HER2 testing, resulting in con-\\nsiderable false-negative and false-positive rates [25]. To overcome these difficulties, \\nASCO and CAP collaborated to develop HER2 testing guidelines to standardize pre-\\nanalytical and analytical procedures and quality assurance measures. The adoption of \\nthe ASCO/CAP guidelines in 2007 led to the following outcomes [26]:\\nThe concordance with FISH improved, and the number of FISH-inconclusive \\ncases decreased from 10.8% to 3.4% (a 64% reduction) [27], resulting in a lower \\nincidence of false-positive IHC results [28].\\nIn 2013, an update of the ASCO/CAP guidelines was published [29]. In 2015, a \\nshort comment on upcoming modifications was also released [30].\\nThe 2018 Focused Update addresses uncommon clinical scenarios and improves \\nclarity, particularly for infrequent HER2 test results that are of uncertain biologic or \\nclinical significance. Updated findings of note include [31]:\\n– Revision of the definition of IHC 2+ (equivocal) to the original FDA-approved \\ncriteria.\\n– Repeat HER2 testing on a surgical specimen if the initially tested core biopsy is \\nnegative is no longer stated as mandatory. A new HER2 test may (no longer \\nshould) be ordered on the excision specimen on the basis of some criteria (such \\nas tumor grade 3).\\n– A more rigorous interpretation criteria of the less common patterns that can be \\nseen in about 5% of all cases when HER2 status in breast cancer is evaluated \\nusing a dual-probe ISH testing. These cases, described as ISH groups 2–4, should \\nnow be assessed using a diagnostic approach that includes a concomitant review \\nof the IHC test, which will help the pathologist make a final determination of the \\ntumor specimen as HER2 positive or negative.\\n– The Expert Panel also preferentially recommends the use of dual-probe instead \\nof single-probe ISH assays, but it recognizes that several single-probe ISH assays \\nhave regulatory approval in many parts of the world.\\nThe current guidelines are as follows [31]:\\nHER2 IHC scoring is reported as follows:\\nNegative\\n6 Prognostic and\\xa0Predictive Factors 177\\nFig. 6.2 Immunohistochemical \\nscore 3+ staining for c-erbB2. \\nStrong, complete membranous \\nstaining with a chicken-wire \\nappearance\\n– Score 0: No staining observed or membrane staining that is incomplete, faint/\\nbarely perceptible and in ≤10% of invasive tumor cells.\\n– Score 1+: Incomplete membrane staining that is faint/barely perceptible and in \\n>10% of invasive tumor cells.\\n– Equivocal (Score2+): Weak/moderate complete membrane staining in >10% of \\ninvasive tumor cells or complete and circumferential membrane staining that is \\nintense and in ≤10% of invasive tumor cells.\\n– Positive (Score3+): Circumferential membrane staining in >10% of invasive \\ntumor cells that is complete and intense (Fig.\\xa06.2).\\n– Samples scored as 3+ are considered unequivocally positive, and those scoring \\n0/1+ are considered negative. Equivocal scores (2+) mandate further assessment \\nusing ISH.\\n– Indeterminate: This category was added in the 2013 update. The test should be \\nreported as indeterminate if technical issues prevent one or both tests (IHC and \\nISH) from being reported as positive, negative or equivocal. Examples include \\ninadequate specimen handling, artifacts (e.g., crushed or marked edge artifacts) \\nthat make interpretation difficult, analytical testing failure or controls that are not \\nas expected. The test should be repeated if possible.\\nISH reporting:\\n– Positive\\n• Single-probe average HER2 copy number ≥6.0 signals/cell (Fig.\\xa06.3).\\n• Dual-probe HER2/CEP17 ratio ≥2.0 with an average HER2 copy number \\n≥4.0 signals per cell.\\n– Negative\\n• Single-probe average HER2 copy number <4.0 signals/cell.\\n• Dual-probe HER2/CEP17 ratio <2.0 with an average HER2 copy number \\n<6.0 signals/cell.\\n178 S. Tuzlali and E. Yavuz\\nFig. 6.3 Gene \\namplification of the same \\ncase with silver in situ \\nhybridization (SISH). \\nNumerous signals per \\nnuclei forming many \\nclusters\\nThe 2018 update on recommendations for HER2 testing with ISH method can-\\ncelled an equivocal result. Instead, forced pathologists to make a judgement as posi-\\ntive or negative using combination of repeated IHC and dual-probe ISH method. \\nAccording to final update, if the HER2/CEP 17 ratio ≥2.0 and average HER2 copy \\nnumber is <4.0 the result should be negative after completion of a work-up. If the \\naverage HER2 copy number is ≥6.0 and the ratio is <2.0 the result should be posi-\\ntive after completion of a work-up [31].\\nRegarding preanalytical and analytical measures, these guidelines recom-\\nmend a cold ischemic time as short as possible and less than 1\\xa0h. Only forma-\\nlin-fixed, paraffin-e mbedded tumor tissue samples are considered appropriate \\nfor assay. Surgical specimens should be incised as soon as possible through the \\ntumor to allow penetration of the fixative. The specimens are fixed in 10% \\nneutral buffered formalin for 6–72\\xa0h, and routine processing and staining or \\nprobing are performed according to standardized analytically validated proto-\\ncols [29].\\n Ki-67\\nKi67 antigen is the most commonly used immunohistochemical marker of cell pro-\\nliferation. It is expressed by proliferating cells in late G1, S and G2/M phases of the \\ncell cycle. Several studies have shown that Ki67 expression correlates with other \\nwell-known markers of proliferation, such as the mitotic index, S-phase fraction, \\ntyrosine kinase and bromodeoxyuridine incorporation.\\nThe clinical utility of Ki67 has been reported in both the adjuvant setting as a \\nprognostic and predictive marker and as an endpoint for neoadjuvant systemic ther-\\napy studies [32]. However, its routine clinical use is controversial due to problems \\nof both preanalytical parameters and methodological differences in scoring.\\n6 Prognostic and\\xa0Predictive Factors 179\\nThe St Gallen breast cancer consensus panel endorses Ki67 as a means to dif-\\nferentiate Luminal A from Luminal B tumors. Acknowledging that the cut-point \\nbetween Ki67 ‘high’ versus ‘low’ tumors varies between laboratories, they accepted \\na level of <14% as having the best correlation with gene expression on the basis of \\nthe results of a single reference laboratory [33, 34]. However, the 14th St Gallen \\nbreast cancer panel declared that the minimum Ki-67 score for luminal B-like is \\n20–29% and that Ki-67 scores should be interpreted according to local laboratory \\nvalues. For example, if a laboratory’s median Ki-67 score is 20% in receptor- \\npositive disease, scores of 30% and above are considered clearly high, whereas \\nscores of 10% and below are considered low [35].\\nThe International Ki67 in Breast Cancer Working Group is cautious in recom-\\nmending the routine use of Ki67 [36]. Because of the lack of standardization of \\nevaluation methods, Ki67 IHC is not recommended by CAP or ASCO [8].\\nSimilar to other biomarkers, many variables (e.g., length of fixation, antigen \\nretrieval method, choice of antibody clone) affect the results of Ki-67 scoring. \\nAmong several antibodies against Ki67, only the mouse monoclonal antibody MIB1 \\nhas been widely adopted for approximately two decades, but a recent rabbit mono-\\nclonal antibody, SP6, has shown similar performance to MIB1 for visual analysis \\nand improved performance for image analysis [37].\\nSubstantial variability in Ki67 scoring is observed among some of the world’s \\nmost experienced laboratories, with moderate concordance at best [38] due to dif-\\nferences in scoring, such as tumor region selection, counting method (hot spot ver-\\nsus average), and subjective assessment of staining positivity.\\nDespite these difficulties, Ki67 can still provide useful information in pathology \\nreports. When very low (a few percent), it can corroborate a Luminal A phenotype \\nin the context of high ER and PR content; a very high Ki67 index can corroborate a \\nLuminal B phenotype regardless of the percentage of ER/PR content; in high-grade \\ntriple-negative tumors, a Ki67 index of >50% is almost universal [32].\\n Gene Expression Tests\\nSeveral gene expression profiling assays have been developed in an attempt to pre-\\ndict the survival and response to therapies of breast cancer patients. These assays are \\nbased on the identification of prognostic gene signatures by using microarrays.\\nPerou [39] and his colleagues were the first to distinguish four molecular classes \\nof breast cancer with their ‘intrinsic’ classification:\\nLuminal cancers are almost all ER positive, express cytokeratin 8 and 18 typical \\nfor the breast glands, and are divided into two categories:\\nLuminal A, which are mostly histologically low grade and express the highest \\nlevels of ER and ER-related genes and lowest levels of proliferation-related genes;\\nLuminal B, which tend to be of high grade with a worse prognosis, with an oppo-\\nsite pattern of gene expression compared with the Luminal A group.\\n180 S. Tuzlali and E. Yavuz\\nHER2-enriched cancers show amplification and overexpression of the ERBB2 \\ngene, do not express hormone receptors and have a poor prognosis.\\nA substantial proportion of breast cancers are HER2-positive but also express \\nER.\\xa0They are classified as “luminal B” cancers.\\nBasal-like breast cancers overlay markedly with ER-, PgR-, and HER2-negative \\n(triple negative) tumors, with poor prognosis and the expression of cytokeratins of \\nthe basal layer (for example, CK 5/6). They are characterized by the expression of \\ngenes that are usually found in the basal/myoepithelial layer of the normal breast, \\nwith high levels of proliferation-related genes.\\nTumors that were initially classified as “normal breast-like” are now accepted as \\nan artifactual group arising from the normal breast epithelium intermixed within the \\ntumor.\\nMore recently, additional subtypes have also been described [40]:\\nMolecular apocrine subtype features activation of androgen receptor signaling.\\nInterferon subtype is characterized by high expression of interferon regulated- \\ngenes, including STAT1.\\nClaudin-low comprises tumors that have transcriptomic features suggestive of a \\n‘cancer stem cell-like’ phenotype with high epithelial-mesenchymal transition \\n(EMT) markers.\\nStudies have revealed that the most stable separation is between basal-like tumors \\nand tumors classified as of another intrinsic subtype. Approximately 70–75% of \\ncancers classified as basal-like by microarrays are triple negative by IHC, and only \\n70–75% of cases that are triple negative by IHC are basal-like by microarrays [41]. \\nFurthermore, there is substantial discrepancy in HER2 status between IHC/FISH \\nand microarray results [42].\\nMany groups have attempted to develop genomic tests based on genomic profil-\\ning with the expectation that this might better predict clinical outcome compared \\nwith standard pathological and clinical markers. The most common tests include the \\nfollowing:\\nMammaPrint This assay, which was developed by The Netherlands Cancer \\nInstitute in 2002, was the first prognostic signature described. Gene expression \\nmicroarray analysis of breast cancer specimens from 78 node-negative patients less \\nthan 55\\xa0years of age was used to develop the 70-gene prognostic signature [43]. By \\ncomparing the expression profiles of tumors from patients who developed distant \\nmetastasis within 5\\xa0years and who did not, the researchers identified a prognostic \\nsignature. This signature was found to be a predictive parameter of outcome and \\npredictive for chemotherapy response in patients with poor prognosis. It was also \\nvalidated in several independent cohort studies and shown to add prognostic infor-\\nmation beyond standard clinicopathological factors in both node-negative and posi-\\ntive patients [44–47].\\nCommercially available MammaPrint categorizes patient into two groups: (a) \\nlow risk (b) and high risk for breast cancer distant relapse within 10\\xa0years of the \\ninitial diagnosis. MammaPrint was developed originally for fresh frozen tissue but \\nnow has FDA clearance for the formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) version.\\n6 Prognostic and\\xa0Predictive Factors 181\\nThe international, prospective, phase III trial “microarray in node-negative and \\n1—3 positive lymph node disease may avoid chemotherapy” (MINDACT, \\nNCT00433589) is designed to address whether chemotherapy can be safely avoided \\nin patients who are predicted to be at low risk by the MammaPrint test but at high \\nrisk by clinical assessment with Adjuvant! Online [48]. MINDACT has shown that \\napproximately 46% of patients who were at high clinical risk for recurrence defined \\nusing Adjuvant! Online might not require chemotherapy. These women had a low \\ngenomic risk for recurrence according to MammaPrint, a genomic signature that \\nassists in predicting clinical outcomes in women with early-stage breast cancer [49].\\nOncotype DX Test (Genomic Health, Redwood, CA, USA) This is a quantitative \\nreverse transcriptase–polymerase chain reaction (RT–PCR) assay generated to mea-\\nsure gene expression in FFPE samples. It measures a panel of 21 genes, including \\n16 cancer-related (prognostic) genes plus five reference genes, and generates a \\nrecurrence score (RS) that classifies patients as at low (RS\\xa0<\\xa018), intermediate (RS \\n18–30), or high (RS\\xa0≥\\xa031) risk of recurrence [50]. The 10-year distant recurrence \\nrates of each category are 6.8%, 14.3%, and 30.5%, respectively.\\nThe test was originally designed to predict distant recurrence in 10\\xa0years in hor-\\nmonal receptor-positive and node-negative breast cancers, and its role in lymph \\nnode-positive patients remains controversial [38].\\nOncotype DX is included in the St Gallen, American Society of Clinical \\nOncology, and National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) guidelines as a \\ndecision tool enabling the identification of patients who are most likely to benefit \\nfrom adjuvant chemotherapy and is indicated for women with node-negative, \\nER-positive breast cancer to determine prognosis in patients who are recommended \\nto proceed with at least a 5-year course of endocrine therapy.\\nThe Trial Assigning IndividuaLized Options for Treatment (Rx) (TAILORx) \\nstudy demonstrated that a group of TAILORx trial participants with low 21-gene \\nrecurrence score (Oncotype DX® Recurrence Score®) results of 10 or less who \\nreceived hormonal therapy alone without chemotherapy had a less than 1% chance \\nof distant recurrence at 5\\xa0years [51].\\nPAM50 (Prosigna) The PAM50 ROR (NanoString Technologies, Seattle, WA, \\nUSA) score is based on a 50-gene test that was developed to identify intrinsic breast \\ncancer subtypes. The ROR is derived from the expression profile of the 50 genes and \\nincludes information on tumor size as well. The ROR score has been validated in \\nwomen with node-negative or node-positive disease and has been shown to classify \\nwomen into low- or high-risk groups and to add prognostic information beyond that \\nof clinical or IHC4 factors [52–54].\\nIn the transATAC trial, the PAM50 ROR score provided more prognostic infor-\\nmation than did RS, with fewer patients categorized as intermediate risk and more \\nas high risk. It also provided at least as much information as IHC4 and may provide \\nmore information in the node-negative/HER2-negative group [55]. The ROR score \\nwas also evaluated in the ABCSG-8 (Austrian Breast and Colorectal Cancer Study \\nGroup 8) trial, in which postmenopausal women with early breast cancer were \\n182 S. Tuzlali and E. Yavuz\\n randomly assigned to receive tamoxifen or anastrozole for 5\\xa0 years. In this large \\nstudy, the ROR score was found to add significant prognostic information beyond \\nthat of clinical parameters for distant recurrence in the overall population and all \\nsubgroups. The study also confirmed the better discrimination between low- and \\nhigh- risk groups in all subgroups [56].\\nThe Genomic Grade Index (GGI) (MapQuant Dx) (Ipsogen, Marseille, France) \\nis a 97-gene microarray signature that assigns a molecular grade.\\nThe Breast Cancer Index (BCI) (BioTheranostics, San Diego, CA, USA) is a \\ncentrally performed qRT–PCR-based assay for use on FFPE tumor blocks.\\nThe EndoPredict test (Sividon Diagnostics GmbH, Koln, Germany), also a qRT–\\nPCR-based multigene assay, measures the expression of eight cancer genes and \\nthree housekeeping control genes (plus one gene to measure the presence of con-\\ntaminating genomic DNA), which are then combined with the classical prognostic \\nfactors of tumor size and node status (EPclin score) to stratify patients with \\nER-positive HER2-negative cancer into a low or high risk of recurrence if treated \\nwith adjuvant endocrine therapy alone.\\nA trial comparing multiparameter tests (MammaPrint, Oncotype DX, Prosigna, \\nIHC4, and IHC4-AQUA) [57] concluded that according to the existing evidence, the \\ndifferent tests provide broadly equivalent risk information for the population of \\nwomen with ER-positive breast cancers. However, for individual patients, the tests \\nmay provide differing risk categorization and subtype information. There was \\nmarked disagreement across all tests. Indeed, for all tests, the level of agreement \\nwas “moderate”.\\nThe major disadvantages of these tests are as follows:\\nThey are informative only in hormone receptor-positive, lymph node-negative \\ncases. Long-term recurrence risk cannot be predicted, except that shown in a study \\nof Prosigna [57]. The cost effectiveness of these tests is another concern. They are \\nperformed in central laboratories, except Prosigna, which can be performed in \\nappropriate local laboratories [54].\\nIn the 8th version of the American Joint Commission of Cancer (AJCC) for \\nbreast cancer, which will be available in 2018, prognostic gene signatures will be \\nintegrated into the staging scheme as prognostic staging [58]:\\nFor patients with hormone receptor-positive, HER2-negative, and lymph node- \\nnegative tumors, prognostic gene signatures (Oncotype DX, MammaPrint, \\nEndopredict, BCI) with a low risk score regardless of T size place the tumor in the \\nsame prognostic category as T1a-T1b N0 M0, and the tumor is staged using the \\nAJCC prognostic stage group table as stage I [58].\\nReferences\\n 1.

Breast ultrasonography (US) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) are \\noften used as an adjuncts to mammography to increase the ability of the radiologist \\nto detect cancer and assess the degree of disease. A\\xa0substantial part of breast imag-\\ning practice involves breast interventional procedures. There are also now many \\ndeveloping breast-imaging technologies to assist in the formulation and confirma-\\ntion of the diagnosis. In this chapter, we aim to provide core knowledge and clinical \\nguidelines for performing and interpreting breast i maging in everyday practice.\\n Mammography\\nMammography is a specialized radiography of the breast that uses X-rays to gener-\\nate images of the breast. The purposes of mammography are early detection of \\nbreast cancer before symptoms (screening mammography) and diagnosis in patients \\nwith symptoms (diagnostic mammography).\\nMammography can be performed using a film screen, phosphor-plate computer \\nradiography or a digital technique. Preference should be given to full-field digital \\nmammography, which has a number of relevant advantages, including a lower \\nX-ray dose, higher image quality, possibility of post-processing, digital archiving, \\nR.

Digital mammography has \\n significantly better detection performance than film-screen mammography in \\npopulation-b ased breast cancer screening. This gain is largely due to enhanced \\ndepiction of microcalcifications, resulting in improved detection of both ductal \\ncarcinoma in situ (DCIS) and invasive carcinoma [3]. Breast doses in digital mam-\\nmography are 22% lower per view than those in film-screen mammography [4]. \\nTwo-view digital and film-screen mammograms have a mean average glandular \\ndose of 3.7 and 4.7\\xa0mGy, respectively [5].\\n Screening Mammography\\nMammography is the only breast imaging examination that has been demonstrated \\nto reduce breast cancer mortality. It is relatively inexpensive and widely available. \\nEarly detection through mass screening with mammography has the potential to \\nreduce mortality. The cancer detection rate of screening mammography is approxi-\\nmately 2–7 per 1000 screened women, depending on the patient population [6].\\nMammography is performed every 1, 2 or 3\\xa0years from the age of 40–50\\xa0years \\nuntil around age 70–75, depending on national/regional screening programs. The \\nrecent recommendations of the American Cancer Society are as follows: (1) reg-\\nular screening mammography starting at 45\\xa0years of age (strong recommenda-\\ntion); (2)\\xa0annual screening mammography from 45 to 54\\xa0years of age (qualified \\nrecommendation); (3) from 55\\xa0years of age, transition to biennial or continuing \\nannually (qualified recommendation); (4) opportunity to begin annual screening \\nfrom 40 to 44\\xa0 years (qualified recommendation); and (5) continued screening \\nmammography as long as the woman’s overall health is good and she has a life \\nexpectancy of ≥10\\xa0years (qualified recommendation) [7]. European guidelines \\nsuggest a 2-year interval for the general female population from 50 to 70\\xa0years \\nof age [8].\\nWith respect to screening, women should be aware that approximately 28% of \\ncancers can be missed, especially in pre-menopausal women and in those with \\ndense breasts [9]. Increased breast density strongly impacts the sensitivity of screen-\\ning mammography, declining from 86 to 89% for almost entirely fatty breasts to \\nonly 62–68% for extremely dense breasts [10]. Nevertheless, mammography is the \\nbest-proven method for screening average-risk women.\\nScreening mammography is a standardized procedure composed of four views, \\ntwo for each breast: the cranio-caudal (CC) projection and the medio-lateral oblique \\n(MLO) projection (Fig.\\xa0 7.1). Screening mammography is performed by a single \\nspecially trained technologist; the acquired images are usually read by two radiolo-\\ngists independently. If the examination is judged to not reveal any abnormality sus-\\npicious for malignancy, the woman receives a report explaining this result. If \\nsomething suspicious is found, the woman is recalled for a customized assessment \\nthat can be variably composed of additional mammographic views, tomosynthesis, \\ncontrast enhanced mammography (CEM), US, MRI or needle biopsy.\\n7 Breast Imaging 191\\na b\\nc d\\nFig. 7.1 Screening mammography in a 49-year-old asymptomatic woman. Bilateral digital cranio-\\ncaudal and mediolateral oblique views demonstrated heterogeneously dense breast tissue (a–d)\\n192 R. Yilmaz\\n Diagnostic Mammography\\nA diagnostic mammography is performed in patients with clinical signs or symp-\\ntoms of breast disease and in patients for whom further evaluation has been requested \\ndue to an abnormal screening mammogram or as a follow-up after prior imaging \\nfindings. When mammography is necessary in patients with symptoms, advantages \\nalways exceed disadvantages regardless of patient age. The patient waits in the \\ndepartment while the radiologist reviews the images; additional mammographic \\nviews and/or US may be obtained at that time to evaluate findings or symptoms. \\nComparison with previous mammography is very valuable and can allow the radi-\\nologist to detect a subtle developing malignancy. Spot compression and magnifica-\\ntion are the mostly commonly used mammographic views to characterize a lesion or \\nhelp image more of the breast tissue. Lateral, rolled CC, exaggerated CC, tangen-\\ntial, and cleavage views are used for the same purpose more rarely. Spot compres-\\nsion uses a smaller paddle to compress the breast focally, distinguish summation of \\nnormal tissue from a true mass, provide visibility of the lesion and evaluate the \\nmargins of a mass (Figs.\\xa07.2 and 7.3). Magnification views are typically used to \\nevaluate the morphology and distribution of microcalcifications; however, these \\nmammographic views may also be helpful in characterizing the margins of a mass \\nand architectural distortion (Fig.\\xa07.4).\\na b c\\nFig. 7.2 First mammography in a 52-year-old asymptomatic woman.

A mammographic report will begin by stating the breast \\ndensity according to the allowed breast density lexicon as fatty, scattered, hetero-\\ngeneously dense, and extremely dense. If a mass is seen, three descriptions are \\nrequired: shape, margin, and density. The shape can be round, oval, or irregular. \\nThe margins can be circumscribed, obscured, microlobulated, indistinct, and spic-\\nulated. The density of the mass can be high density, equal density, low density, \\nand fat containing. Of these descriptions, a mass that is an irregular shape with \\nspiculated margins and high density is the most concerning for malignancy \\n194 R.

Spot \\nmagnification on craniocaudal mammogram demonstrated dense pleomorphic calcifications suspi-\\ncious for malignancy (c). They are in a segmental distribution directed toward the nipple. An image \\nfrom targeted US showed an irregular heterogenous mass with indistinct margins and echogenic \\ncalcifications (arrows) (d)\\n(Fig.\\xa07.5). By contrast, a mass that is a round shape with circumscribed margins is \\nmore likely benign, especially if it is fat containing (Fig.\\xa07.6). Malignant tumors \\nrarely feature this appearance, but high density attracts attention (Fig.\\xa07.7).\\nArchitectural distortion refers to breast parenchymal architecture without a \\ndefinable mass and can be due to malignant lesions, such as invasive cancer or \\nDCIS, or to benign lesions, such as a radial scar or a complex sclerosing lesion \\n(Fig.\\xa07.8). The positive predictive value for malignancy is approximately 75% [11, \\n12]. Architectural distortion may be the earliest manifestation of breast cancer and \\nis the most commonly missed abnormality on false-negative mammograms [13]. \\nDistortion is best observed on magnified views or tomosynthesis images and is \\noften subtle on US.\\nAn asymmetry is seen on only one of the two standard mammographic views, \\neither CC or MLO, lacks convex borders, may or may not contain interspersed fat, \\nand occupies less than one quadrant of the breast. It is found on 3.3% of all s creening \\nmammograms [14]. Persistent asymmetries have been reported to be malignant in \\n10.3% of screening-detected cases [14]. A focal asymmetry has a similar appear-\\nance on both the CC and MLO views, lacks convex borders, and may contain inter-\\nspersed fat. A developing asymmetry is a focal asymmetry that was not present on \\n7 Breast Imaging 195\\na b c d\\ne\\nFig. 7.5 A 61-year-old woman with a palpable lump in the left breast (a–d).

Some of the \\nmore common benign causes include cysts, fibrocystic changes, pseudoangioma-\\ntous stromal hyperplasia (PASH), scars, focal infections, weight loss or gain, \\ntrauma, fat necrosis, and hormone replacement therapy [15]. Malignant developing \\nasymmetries may represent invasive ductal carcinoma (IDC), invasive lobular carci-\\nnoma (ILC), mixed IDC and ILC, invasive mucinous carcinoma, and ductal carci-\\nnoma in situ [15]. A developing asymmetry has a moderate likelihood of malignancy \\nand is seen on 12.8% of screening and 26.7% of diagnostic mammograms [16]. \\n200 R. Yilmaz\\nDeveloping asymmetries identified at screening mammography can be further \\n evaluated with diagnostic mammography, tomosynthesis, breast US, and MRI.\\nCalcifications were previously separated into three categories: typically \\nbenign, intermediate concern, and higher probability. They are now consolidated \\ninto two categories: typically benign and suspicious morphology. In the “typi-\\ncally benign” category, eggshell and lucent-centered calcifications have been \\ncombined into a new term, rim, whereas round and punctate calcifications are \\ncombined into the term round (Fig.\\xa0 7.10). Amorphous, coarse heterogeneous, \\nfine pleomorphic, and fine linear or fine linear branching calcifications are now \\nplaced in the “suspicious m orphology” category (Fig.\\xa07.11). Calcifications with \\nsuspicious morphology have an increased risk for malignancy, with a probability \\na b\\nFig. 7.10 First mammography in a 44-year-old asymptomatic woman.

The \\ndistribution of calcifications is also an important factor in characterizing calcifi-\\ncations as suspicious or benign. The distributions are diffuse, regional, grouped, \\nlinear, and segmental. Pleomorphic and linear calcifications in a segmental or \\nductal distribution are highly suspicious for DCIS. Calcifications that are believed \\nto be probably benign, indicating a 2% or lower chance of malignancy, are usu-\\nally recommended for follow-up mammography at 6-, 12-, and 24-month inter-\\nvals. Calcifications that cannot be categorized definitively as benign or suspicious \\nare reported as indeterminate and are usually also recommended for stereotactic \\nbiopsy.\\n202 R.

Yilmaz\\n Ultrasonography\\nUltrasonography uses high-frequency sound waves to produce images of internal \\norgans and breast tissue. No X-rays are used. Among methods for imaging the \\nbreast, US is second to mammography because of its use for many years, its acces-\\nsibility and relatively low cost, and the unique opportunity it affords for real-time \\nguidance of needle biopsy and other interventional procedures.\\nCurrent indications for US examination of the breast include the following: (1) first \\nexamination (before mammography or MRI) for the evaluation of a palpable lump in \\nwomen under age 30; (2) evaluation of a mass demonstrated on mammography; (3) \\nevaluation of focal asymmetry or focal change in architecture on the mammogram \\ncompared with a previous study, performed after complete mammographic workup \\n(additional views); (4) evaluation of suspicious finding requiring biopsy on MRI or a \\nnuclear medicine study (in anticipation of US-guided biopsy); (5) guidance for intra-\\noperative or percutaneous breast biopsy and aspiration; (6)\\xa0 evaluation of breast \\nimplants; (7) evaluation of lactating and pregnant women; (8) adjunctive examination \\nto evaluate nipple discharge (after mammography); and (9) adjunctive examination to \\nevaluate focal pain (after mammography). US can also be used to follow low-suspi-\\ncion lesions and to evaluate the response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy.\\nUS enables highly sensitive differentiation of benign breast lesions from malig-\\nnant ones [18, 19]. Additional techniques, such as color Doppler and harmonic and \\ncompound imaging, can aid lesion analysis [20]. As technology continues to \\nimprove and the common practice of breast US increases, the diagnostic capabilities \\nof breast US will expand.\\nScreening breast US is capable of detecting some cancers that are undetected by \\nmammography and physical examination. For some states, US is recommended in \\nmammography reports [21]. However, it has not been established that women will \\nbenefit from the incorporation of sonography into routine breast cancer screening \\nprograms.\\nUS is useful in differentiating solid versus cystic breast lesions. A simple cyst \\nshould be anechoic with well-circumscribed margins upon acoustic enhancement \\ndue to greater sound transmission through the fluid than the surrounding breast tis-\\nsue. A solid mass contains internal echoes. US features of benign lesions include \\nwell-defined margins, few gentle lobulations, a thin echogenic capsule and a hori-\\nzontal axis parallel to the chest wall (Fig.\\xa07.12). Cancers are generally hypoechoic \\nrelative to the brightly echogenic normal fibroglandular tissue. The following fea-\\ntures suggest cancer: margins that are angulated, indistinct, microlobulated, or spic-\\nulated; acoustic shadowing; microcalcifications; ductal extension; an echogenic \\nhalo; and a taller than wide configuration (Fig.\\xa07.13). Posterior acoustic shadowing \\nis reported to occur in 60–97% of spiculated carcinomas. US is also the first modal-\\nity used in patients with a suspected breast abscess because these patients often have \\ntoo much pain to tolerate the compression required for mammography.\\nUS is the primary nonsurgical method for evaluating axillary nodes [22]. The \\noverall size of the node has very poor diagnostic accuracy for predicting metastasis, \\nhowever, and in the absence of other associated findings, overall size should not be \\n7 Breast Imaging 205\\na b\\nc\\nFig. 7.12 A 49-year-old woman with a palpable lump in the right upper inner quadrant.

The normal axillary lymph node should be oval and should have \\na smooth, well-defined margin. The cortex should be slightly hypoechoic and uni-\\nformly thin, measuring 3\\xa0mm or less (Fig.\\xa07.14). Demonstrating arterial flow in the \\nechogenic hilum is valuable for normal lymph nodes. Nodes that meet this descrip-\\ntion have a very high negative predictive value for excluding metastasis [22]. A\\xa0focal \\ncortical bulge or thickening, effacement of the fatty hilum or a rounded hypoechoic \\nnode, ill-defined contours and non-hilar blood flow are important findings for diag-\\nnosing abnormal nodes [23] (Fig.\\xa07.15).\\nFig. 7.14 Image from \\naxilla US showing a \\nnormal-appearing \\novoid-shaped lymph node \\nwith thin cortex and fatty \\nhilum (arrows)\\na b\\nFig. 7.15 A 56-year-old woman with a history of breast cancer presenting with axillary lymph \\nnodes.

As a diagnostic tool differing from mam-\\nmography and US, MRI can show the tissue perfusion characteristics of masses on \\nthe breast parenchyma as well as morphological features. Although MRI has \\nextremely high sensitivity in the diagnosis of breast cancer, reaching 89–100% for \\ninvasive cancers, specificity is only 72% and widely varies according to the criteria \\nused in the differentiation of malignant from benign lesions [24–26]. Unfortunately, \\nthe moderate specificity of breast MRI, especially in the hands of inexperienced \\nreaders, can lead to more examinations rather than less. MRI is based on the use of \\n(a) a strong magnetic field provided by a high-quality magnet; (b) low-energy \\nradiofrequency waves radiated and received by special coils inside the magnet and \\npositioned close to the investigated body part. The patient is placed in a prone posi-\\ntion with the breasts hanging into a bilateral phased-array breast coil after place-\\nment of an intravenous catheter. However, to diagnose or exclude a cancer, \\nintravenous administration of a gadolinium-based contrast material is required. \\nWhen MRI is performed solely to evaluate silicone implant integrity, gadolinium \\nis not necessary. Claustrophobia, implantable devices, allergic predisposition, and \\nrenal function should be checked.\\nMajor clinical indications of MRI in breast diseases are suspicion of implant \\nrupture, screening in high-risk women, solving difficult cases after standard \\n imaging, local staging of breast cancer, suspicion of primary breast cancer in \\npatients with metastatic axillary lymph nodes, differentiation of benign post-thera-\\npeutic changes, local recurrence in a treated breast, and monitoring neoadjuvant \\ntreatment efficacy (Fig.\\xa07.16).\\nNormal fibroglandular tissue exhibits physiological enhancement, which can \\nmake detection of malignancy more difficult and increase the likelihood of false \\npositives. The amount of background parenchymal enhancement is affected by hor-\\nmonal status. To reduce this effect, elective or screening MR imaging must be \\nscheduled between days 7 and 14 after the first day of the menstrual cycle. If MRI \\nmust be performed for another indication, speed may be more important than \\n adequate scheduling.\\nMorphological analysis is performed by evaluating the shape, margin, and enhance-\\nment characteristics of the masses and the distribution and internal enhancement \\n pattern of nonmass lesions. Kinetic analysis is performed by evaluating the initial \\nenhancement rate and postinitial enhancement of the lesions. Although certain lesion \\ncharacteristics, such as irregular or spiculated margins, rim enhancement, d uctal or \\nsegmental enhancement, and rapid initial enhancement with a wash-out course, are \\nhighly suggestive of malignancy, certain lesion characteristics, such as smooth mar-\\ngins, less enhancement compared to the surrounding breast parenchyma, and nonen-\\nhancing internal septations are highly suggestive of benign disease (Figs.\\xa07.17 and \\n7.18) [26]. A lack of enhancement is strongly suggestive of benignity but does not \\nnecessarily exclude malignancy.\\n208 R.

MRI detects \\nunsuspected cancer in the contralateral breast in 3% of these patients [27]. MRI \\ndetects additional disease in 27–34% of patients, resulting in wider surgical exci-\\nsion or mastectomy [28–30].\\nDiffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) was recently integrated into the standard \\nbreast MRI examination to increase the specificity of breast MRI. It is a noninvasive \\ntechnique that measures the random motion of free water protons and characterizes \\nthe tissues with a mechanism that differs from T1 and T2 relaxation. For the quan-\\ntification of this motion, apparent diffusion characteristic values are used. \\n7 Breast Imaging 209\\na b\\nc\\nd\\nFig. 7.17 A 51-year-old woman with a palpable lump in the right breast.

Tomosynthesis has been shown \\n7 Breast Imaging 211\\nto increase the conspicuity of many lesions while reducing false-positive findings \\nfrom summation of overlapping tissues [34]. Several studies of reductions in \\nbreast cancer screening recall rates have reported improved sensitivity and speci-\\nficity with the use of DBT [35–38]. Specifically, in a study by Dang et\\xa0al. 16% of \\ninvasive breast cancers were occult on conventional mammography versus 3% on \\nDBT [39]. In another study, radiologists indicated that the availability of DBT \\nwould have eliminated use of US as part of the diagnostic process in 12% of cases \\n[40]. There is concern about the increased radiation dose to the patient with the \\nuse of DBT.\\xa0In a paper reporting results from the Oslo Trial (similar population \\nand acquisition protocol, same system manufacturer), mean glandular doses per \\nview of 1.58\\xa0mGy for digital mammography and 1.95\\xa0mGy for DBT were reported, \\nrepresenting a dose increase of 23% for tomosynthesis [41]. The use of synthetic \\n2D images with DBT is now FDA approved and would reduce the radiation dose \\nto that of a standard mammogram while allowing the acquisition of both 2D and \\n3D images.\\n Contrast Enhanced Mammography\\nContrast enhanced mammography is an FDA-approved technology that, similar \\nto MRI, is based on the principle of imaging neovascularity. CEM requires \\napproximately 8–10\\xa0min to perform and provides four low-energy views analo-\\ngous to those obtained with 2D full-field digital mammography as well as four \\ncontrast-enhanced recombined images obtained after intravenous iodinated con-\\ntrast. Similar to conventional mammography images, CEM images are acquired \\nin cranio-caudal and mediolateral oblique views. Early studies have even demon-\\nstrated that the performance of CEM is superior to that of mammography alone \\nin the diagnostic setting and comparable to the performance of MRI in women \\nwith known cancers [42–44]. For CEM, the mean glandular dose estimates vary \\naccording to breast density and are estimated to be 20–80% higher than those \\nassociated with standard 2D digital mammography alone but lower than those \\nassociated with DBT [45]. The additional dose should be kept in mind when \\ndeciding to use this examination, especially in patients who may be particularly \\nsensitive to radiation [46].\\n Elastography\\nBreast elastography is emerging as an efficient tool to detect malignant solid lesions \\nby measuring the tissue strain produced by compression. It is easily performed in \\nclinical practice and adds only a short amount of time to breast ultrasonography. In \\nbreast ultrasonography, two elastographic techniques are popular and differ in the \\n212 R. Yilmaz\\nFig. 7.19 Invasive carcinoma in a 35-year-old woman with pain in the left breast. Strain elasto-\\ngram imaging revealed an irregular heterogeneous hyperechoic mass showing a predominantly \\nblue lesion with some green portions (high hardness)\\ntype of stress applied: strain and shear-wave elastography (SWE). Strain elastogra-\\nphy produces an image based on the relative displacement of the tissue from an \\nexternal (manual compression of the transducer) or patient source (Fig.\\xa07.19). SWE \\nusing the acoustic radiation force induced by the US push pulse generated by the \\ntransducer provides quantitative elasticity parameters. SWE has been shown to be \\nuseful for differentiating benign breast lesions from malignant breast lesions and for \\ncharacterizing breast masses categorized as BI-RADS categories 3 and 4A to \\nattempt to reduce unnecessary breast biopsies [47]. SWE exhibits 86.5% sensitivity, \\n89.8% specificity and 88.3% accuracy in discriminating benign and malignant \\nbreast lesions [48]. It has been suggested that SWE enhances the diagnostic perfor-\\nmance of ultrasonography, potentially improving the specificity of conventional \\nultrasonography.\\n Breast Imaging Reporting and\\xa0Data System (BI-RADS)\\nThe Breast Imaging Reporting and Data System (BI-RADS) is a classification sys-\\ntem proposed by the American College of Radiology (ACR) in 1986; the original \\nreport was released in 1993. BI-RADS serves to standardize breast imaging reports, \\nimprove communication with referring physicians, and provide a quality assurance \\ntool. The latest edition is BI-RADS 5, which was updated in 2013 [17]. The \\nBI-RADS lexicon is a dictionary of descriptive terms used to describe a mammo-\\ngraphic, US, or MRI finding. The ACR used scientific analysis and literature review \\nto create a lexicon of descriptors shown to correlate with high predictive values \\nassociated with either benign or malignant disease. The other important aspect of \\nthe BI-RADS system is the category classification for the overall assessment of the \\nimaging findings. This categorization provides an approximate risk of malignancy \\nof a lesion from essentially zero to greater than 95%. The categorization and final \\nassessment decrease ambiguity in recommendations. These assessment categories \\nand recommendations are presented in Table\\xa07.1.\\n7 Breast Imaging 213\\nTable 7.1 Assessment categories and recommendations of BI-RADS\\nAssessment Management Likelihood of cancer\\nCategory 0: Incomplete— Recall for additional imaging and/ N/A\\nneed additional evaluation or comparison with prior \\nand/or prior mammograms examination(s)\\nfor comparison\\nCategory 1: Negative Routine mammography screening Essentially 0% likelihood of \\nmalignancy\\nCategory 2: Benign Routine mammography screening Essentially 0% likelihood of \\nmalignancy\\nCategory 3: Probably benign Short-interval (6-month) >0% but ≤2% likelihood of \\nfollow-up or continued malignancy\\nsurveillance mammography\\nCategory 4: Suspicious Tissue diagnosis >2% but <95% likelihood of \\nmalignancy\\nCategory 4A: Low suspicion >2% but ≤10% likelihood \\nfor malignancy of malignancy\\nCategory 4B: Moderate >10 to ≤50% likelihood of \\nsuspicion for malignancy malignancy\\nCategory 4C: High suspicion >50 to <95% likelihood of \\nfor malignancy malignancy\\nCategory 5: Highly Tissue diagnosis ≥95% likelihood of \\nsuggestive of malignancy malignancy\\nCategory 6: Known Surgical excision when clinically N/A\\nbiopsy-proven malignancy appropriate\\n Image-Guided Biopsy\\nThe decision to perform an image-guided biopsy includes the selection of the imag-\\ning modality to guide the biopsy and the type of biopsy device. Stereotactic, ultra-\\nsonography, and magnetic resonance imaging are most frequently used for biopsy \\nguidance. Other imaging modalities that use nuclear metabolic agents such as fluo-\\nrodeoxyglucose and sestamibi are infrequently used. In general, the modality used \\nfor imaging guidance should be the one that best demonstrates the lesion. If the \\npathology results are not concordant with the imaging finding, surgical excision or \\nadditional tissue sampling is recommended.\\n Ultrasonography-Guided Biopsy\\nAmong imaging techniques used to evaluate breast abnormalities and guide inter-\\nventions for tissue sampling or surgical excision, US is the most common method \\nand the only one performed in real time. Patients and physicians prefer US guid-\\nance for its rapidity, comfort (the patient is supine or supine-oblique rather than \\n214 R. Yilmaz\\nprone as she would be for stereotactic or MRI-guided biopsies), reliability, and \\naccuracy. US is the choice for biopsy of solid masses with automated biopsy \\ndevices using 12- or 14-gauge needles or with vacuum-assisted devices that yield \\nlarger specimens obtained with needles ranging from 8 to 12 gauge, as well as \\nbiopsy devices using other mechanisms (Fig.\\xa0 7.20). US-guided 14-gauge core \\nneedle biopsy had a false- negative rate of 1.6% (11 of 671 malignancies) in non-\\npalpable lesions [49]. A minimum of four specimens, preferably those that are \\nnonfragmented and that sink, should be obtained by 14-gauge US-guided breast \\nbiopsy [50].\\nSuspicious calcifications usually undergo biopsy with stereotactic guidance. \\nHowever, calcifications can be identified on US scans obtained with high-fre-\\nquency transducers, particularly when associated with a mass. In these cases, \\nUS-guided biopsy may be performed instead of stereotactic biopsy, and specimen \\nradiography should be performed to document calcifications in the tissue cores. \\nSecond-look US is commonly performed to locate a mass that correlates with an \\nenhancing lesion seen on MRI. Biopsy can then be guided with US and accom-\\nplished more rapidly, in real time, and more comfortably for the patient than an \\nMRI-guided biopsy.\\nUS is also an excellent imaging guide for presurgical localization and for the \\naspiration of cysts and drainage of abscesses. Simple cysts do not require treatment; \\nhowever, some patients desire US-guided aspiration for symptomatic relief. If a \\nmass cannot be identified as a complicated cyst or a solid mass, aspiration may be \\nperformed initially. If the fluid is bloody, it should be sent for cytology. If no fluid \\ncan be aspirated, it can be assumed that the mass is solid, and a core biopsy may be \\nperformed. If the cyst contains a solid nodule, the nodule should undergo core \\nbiopsy prior to aspiration of the fluid.\\nFig. 7.20 Ultrasonography- \\nguided core biopsy of the \\nmass revealed an invasive \\nductal carcinoma. The \\nhyperechoic line traversing \\nthe lesion is the biopsy \\nneedle (arrows)\\n7 Breast Imaging 215\\n Stereotactic-Guided Biopsy\\nStereotactic breast biopsy is an X-ray-guided method that uses 3-dimensional \\nimages to localize and sample breast lesions discovered on mammography. The \\nbiopsy is performed primarily for microcalcifications but also includes masses, \\nasymmetries, and architectural distortions that cannot be identified at US.\\nThe patient is positioned either prone or seated, and the breast is compressed \\nbetween the image receptor and the compression plate. Two 15-degree angled X-ray \\nimages of the lesion allow targeting by the radiologist to produce computer- \\ngenerated coordinates that are transferred to the stereotactic biopsy device. An 8- to \\n11-gauge vacuum-assisted biopsy device is now the standard choice. The vacuum- \\nassisted biopsy device retrieves a larger volume of tissue compared with core biopsy, \\nminimizing the rate of histologic upgrades. At the end of the biopsy, a tissue marker \\n(“biopsy clip”) is placed to indicate the biopsy site and to localize the lumpectomy \\nor excision. When the targeted lesion contains calcifications, a specimen radiograph \\nis obtained to document the presence of calcifications within the tissue cores.\\n MRI-Guided Biopsy\\nBreast MR imaging can detect some suspicious lesions that are occult on mammog-\\nraphy and US.\\xa0Using the three-dimensional location information from MR imaging, \\nsome lesions can be identified with targeted US and sampled by using US guidance. \\nHowever, this requires a good working knowledge of both modalities, the ability to \\ntranslate the expected lesion position and appearance from one modality to another, \\nand a meticulous radiologic-pathologic correlation when the results are returned to \\nensure that the US finding truly represents the lesion identified at MR imaging. If the \\nlesion is only visualized with MR imaging, then MRI-guided biopsy is performed.\\nMRI-guided biopsy is difficult and troublesome for patients and radiologists \\nbecause the patient is prone and requires intravenous administration of gadolinium \\nfor lesion visualization, breast compression for lesion targeting, and several MRI \\nsequences to confirm accuracy. The usual practice after a benign MR biopsy result \\nis to perform short-term follow-up MRI, 6\\xa0months after the procedure, due to a 1% \\nrate of missed carcinoma [51, 52].\\n Preoperative Localization of\\xa0Non-Palpable Breast Lesions\\nApproximately 25–30% of breast cancers are non-palpable at diagnosis and will \\nrequire a localization technique to assist surgery [53, 54]. Wire-guided localization \\nis the most frequently used method and entails the insertion of a wire via US, \\n216 R. Yilmaz\\nmammographic or MRI guidance on the day of operation to assist the surgeon \\nin\\xa0localizing the tumor intra-operatively (Fig.\\xa07.21). An alternative is marking by a \\nradioactive agent (radio-guided occult lesion localization; ROLL). In this technique, \\na titanium seed of iodine-125 is inserted into the tumor under mammographic or US \\nguidance. A gamma probe is used intraoperatively by the surgeon to localize the \\nnon-palpable tumor and guide surgical excision. ROLL adds flexibility to clinical \\nschedules as well as to the planning of the localization approach and surgical inci-\\nsion site. The seeds are placed internally, with no external wires extruding from the \\nskin surface; patient satisfaction is markedly enhanced, and there is also no risk of \\nwire dislodgement, migration, or transection with resultant loss of localization [55]. \\nLocalization tends to be more accurate and faster, the excision procedure is more \\nelegant and simple to perform, and the cosmetic result seems to be better.\\nThe major disadvantage of ROLL compared with wire localization is patient and \\nenvironmental radiation exposure. However, there is no need for extra radiation- \\nprotection procedures because the dose exposure is far below the annual limit [56]. \\nAnother potential disadvantage of ROLL compared with wire localization is that \\nseeds that are not initially placed in a satisfactory position generally cannot be \\nremoved preoperatively. A second seed (or wire) must then be placed to accurately \\nlocalize the lesion, and both seeds are subsequently retrieved at surgery [55]. \\nDisease recurrence rates and positive margin rates are similar for wire-guided local-\\nization and ROLL [57]. There was no difference in specimen size or re-excision rate \\nfor malignant lesions between the two methods [58]. Application of ROLL under \\nMRI guidance can be performed for the preoperative localization of breast lesions \\ndetected only by MRI [59]. A specimen radiograph should be obtained at the time \\nof surgery to confirm that the localized lesion has been removed, along with biopsy \\nclips, wires, or radioactive seeds when the procedure is performed using mammo-\\ngraphic guidance. Surgically placed markers, orthogonal sample views, and careful \\nmonitoring of the lesion and its relationship to the localizing markers permit an \\nassessment of which  margin is close.\\n High-Risk Screening\\nBreast cancer screening recommendations are based on risk factors. Women are \\nconsidered at high risk of developing breast cancer if their estimated lifetime risk is \\n20% or greater based on family history, if they have a known or suspected BRCA or \\nother high-risk genetic mutation, or if they had mantle radiation therapy to the chest \\nprior to age 30. Lifetime risk is assessed using the Gail, Tyrer-Cuzick, BRCAPRO, \\nand Claus models [60–62].\\nThe Society of Breast Imaging and American College of Radiology recommend \\nthat women with a BRCA1 or BRCA2 gene mutation or those who have not been \\ntested but have a first-degree relative with a known BRCA mutation have annual \\nmammograms starting by age 30 but not before age 25. The recommendation for \\nwomen with a greater than or equal to 20% lifetime risk for breast cancer based on \\n7 Breast Imaging 217\\na d\\nb c\\nFig. 7.21 Follow-up imaging of a 42-year-old woman 5\\xa0years after surgery for breast cancer.

Yilmaz\\nfamily history is to have annual mammography starting by age 30 (but not before \\nage 25) or 10\\xa0years earlier than the age of diagnosis of the youngest affected rela-\\ntive, whichever is later. For women who are at a high risk due to prior mantle radia-\\ntion between the ages of 10–30, mammography is recommended starting 8\\xa0years \\nafter radiation therapy but not before age 25. Those women who have had a biopsy \\nshowing lobular carcinoma in situ, atypical lobular hyperplasia, atypical ductal \\nhyperplasia, or DCIS should have annual mammograms from the time of diagnosis, \\nregardless of age [63].\\nSupplemental screening with breast MRI is recommended for these patients at \\nhigh risk for breast cancer. When data from 11 prospective studies were combined \\nin a meta-analysis, the sensitivity was 77% for MR imaging alone, 94% for a com-\\nbination of MR imaging and mammography, and 39% for mammography alone \\n[64]. The highest sensitivity was achieved by using a combination of mammogra-\\nphy and MR imaging. A modeling study reported that the most efficacious screen-\\ning strategy for carriers of BRCA mutations was to start screening with MR imaging \\nannually at age 25 and to add annual mammography at age 30; due to the high tumor \\ngrowth rate and shorter lead time of BRCA-related breast cancers, alternating MR \\nimaging and mammographic screening examinations at 6-month intervals may also \\nbe a clinically effective approach [65, 66]. Women with a history of chest irradiation \\nare recommended to have a screening MRI annually starting 8\\xa0years after radiation \\ntherapy [48]. In the American College of Radiology Imaging Network 6666 trial, \\nwomen cited their inability to tolerate the long acquisition time because of claustro-\\nphobia (25.4%) and time constraints (18.2%) as the primary reasons they refused \\nMRI screening [67]. Short-protocol breast MRI can replace rutin-protocol MRI to \\nscreen patients at high breast cancer risk [68, 69].\\nUS can be considered in high-risk women for whom MRI screening may be appro-\\npriate but who cannot have MRI for any reason or in women with dense breast tissue \\nas an adjunct to mammography. A recent large multicenter trial concluded that in \\nhigh-risk women, the use of screening US as a supplement to mammography in addi-\\ntion to screening mammography increases the detection of cancer by 3–4 per 1000 \\ncompared to mammography alone [21]. This increased detection rate does come at the \\ncost of increased false positives. An average of 4.4% of women underwent biopsy due \\nto screening US findings, with a positive predictive value (PPV) of 9.4% [21].\\nFor intermediate-risk women (lifetime risk of 15–20%), US or MRI may be indi-\\ncated as an adjunct to mammography depending upon specific risk factors [63]. \\nHowever, CEM may also be an ideal alternative for women with an intermediate \\nrisk of breast cancer who may not be eligible for supplemental screening MRI [45].\\n Conclusion\\nBreast imaging is indispensable and the most important component of breast cancer \\ndiagnosis. Mammography is the standard imaging procedure for breast cancer \\ndetection and diagnosis. Breast US and MRI are frequently used adjuncts to \\n7 Breast Imaging 219\\nmammography, and these techniques enhance the radiologist’s ability to detect can-\\ncer and assess disease extent. Many developing technologies can assist the formula-\\ntion and confirmation of a diagnosis, such as DBT, CEM, and elastography US.\\nAdvances and ongoing improvements in imaging technologies have improved \\nthe sensitivity of breast cancer detection and diagnosis, but there is no single imag-\\ning modality that is capable of identifying and characterizing all breast abnormali-\\nties. Each modality is most beneficial when utilized according to individual traits \\nsuch as age, risk, and breast density.\\nReferences\\n 1.

Nuclear \\nmedicine imaging, which includes single-photon emission computerized tomogra-\\nphy (SPECT) and positron emission tomography (PET), can measure the cellular, \\nmolecular, and biochemical properties of neoplasms and normal tissues in\\xa0 vivo. \\nHybrid imaging systems such as PET/CT, PET/MR and SPECT/CT devices, which \\ncombine functional and anatomical information, can localize processes within the \\nbody to an anatomically identifiable or, in some instances, as yet unidentifiable \\nstructural alteration. While molecular imaging with PET is a rapidly emerging \\napproach in breast cancer, conventional single-photon nuclear medicine imaging, \\nincluding bone scintigraphy and sentinel lymph node scintigraphy, still has an \\nimportant role in the management of breast cancer. Nuclear medicine imaging sys-\\ntems are designed primarily for whole-body imaging, which is one of the strengths \\nof this modality. SPECT imaging uses nuclides such as 99mTc, which decay while \\nemitting single γ-ray photons with different energies. In contrast to SPECT agents, \\nPET agents use pharmaceuticals labeled with positron-emitting radionuclides, \\nwhich are produced mainly by cyclotrons.\\nPET/CT is a molecular imaging exam that is commonly used to target cancer \\ncells and is an essential component of staging and monitoring treatment for \\nnumerous types of cancer.

Turkmen\\nthe different biological processes of breast cancer will allow progress not only in \\ndiagnosing disease at an early stage but also in enabling personalized therapy for \\npatients with breast cancer.\\n Scintimammography\\nScintimammography is a functional imaging methodology that provides a non- \\ninvasive in\\xa0vivo differentiation of malignant from benign processes and is helpful in \\nclinical scenarios where mainstay anatomic modalities such as mammography, \\nultrasound and MRI are limited [1]. Scintimammography employs a wide range of \\ninstrumentation applications. In recent years, conventional planar scintimammogra-\\nphy has been enhanced by SPECT and hybrid SPECT/CT and dedicated small field \\nof view (FOV) breast-specific gamma imaging (BSGI) devices. Technetium-99m \\n(Tc-99m) MIBI is the radiopharmaceutical of choice for SPECT studies in breast \\nimaging [2]. Tc-99m MIBI is localized to the dense mitochondria characteristic of \\nmalignant cells, with its uptake dependent on regional blood flow, tumor angiogen-\\nesis, and increased metabolism and driven by plasma membrane potentials and \\nmitochondrial membrane potentials [3, 4]. A number of studies have consistently \\nshown that early tracer uptake reflects mitochondrial status, which is affected by \\nboth apoptosis and proliferation, whereas tracer clearance reflects the activity of \\ndrug transporters such as P-glycoprotein [5, 6]. Many clinical studies have high-\\nlighted that both proliferative activity and the apoptotic index correlate directly with \\nTc-99m MIBI uptake [7, 8].\\nThe results of a recent meta-analysis that systematically evaluated the diagnostic \\nvalue of BSGI and MRI in the same cohort of patients with breast cancer showed \\nthat compared with MRI, BSGI had comparable sensitivity (84% vs. 89%) but \\nhigher specificity (82% vs. 39%) and diagnostic efficacy (AUC 0.93 vs. 0.72), indi-\\ncating excellent diagnostic performance [9]. Given the high specificity of scinti-\\nmammography, a positive scintigraphic finding would support a recommendation of \\nan invasive evaluation. Many well-known factors, including tumor type (poorly dif-\\nferentiated DCIS, lobular and tubulolobular carcinomas), size (<1\\xa0cm), cellularity, \\nblood supply and cell viability, can cause a false negative result on scintimammog-\\nraphy [10, 11]. Scintimammography also has limitations in detecting axillary lymph \\nnodes and delineating adjacent lesions. However, the combined functional and mor-\\nphological information provided by SPECT-CT significantly increases the diagnos-\\ntic value of noninvasive detection of axillary lymph node invasion by breast cancer; \\nthe sensitivity of SPECT-CT 1.4 times higher (from 55% to 75%) than that of CT, \\nwith excellent specificity (97% and 89%) and comparable overall accuracy (82% \\nand 84%) [12]. Breast benign hyperplasia lesions such as fibrocystic change and \\nfibroadenoma can also cause false positive results in scintimammography. An effec-\\ntive radiation dose was estimated to be 5.9–9.4\\xa0mSv compared to 0.44\\xa0mSv for digi-\\ntal mammography [13].\\n8 Nuclear Medicine Imaging in\\xa0Breast Cancer 225\\nAnother potential clinical application of Tc-99m MIBI scintimammography is \\nto predict the response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy in patients with breast can-\\ncer. Tc-99m MIBI scintimammography has also been used for decades to monitor \\nthe treatment response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy. In a recent meta-analysis, \\nfor all 14 studies included, pooled sensitivity was 0.86 (95% CI: 0.78–0.92), and \\npooled specificity was 0.69 (95% CI: 0.64–0.74) for the accuracy of Tc-99m \\nMIBI scintimammography in the prediction of neoadjuvant chemotherapy \\nresponse in breast cancer [14]. These results indicate that Tc-99m MIBI scinti-\\nmammography could yield high sensitivity but low specificity, which must be \\nconsidered cautiously in clinical practice. This analysis suggests that a negative \\nscintimammography result does not fully exclude the presence of a residual tumor, \\nespecially remaining ductal carcinoma in situ or residual tumor less than 1\\xa0cm in \\nsize. Subgroup analysis also showed that performing early mid-treatment Tc-99m \\nMIBI scintimammography (using the reduction rate of one or two cycles or within \\nthe first half-courses of chemotherapy compared with baseline) was superior to \\nlater (after three courses or more) or post-treatment scintimammography for pre-\\ndicting neoadjuvant chemotherapy response. Lee et\\xa0 al. reported that MRI had \\nadded value to scintimammography in the detection of residual tumor after neo-\\nadjuvant chemotherapy and that scintimammography could help locate tumors \\nafter therapy that were false negative on MRI.\\xa0 However, a direct comparison \\nbetween MRI and scintimammography was statistically insignificant. Thus, it is \\nsuggested that a combination of scintimammography and MRI in the prediction of \\ntreatment response would be more accurate [15].\\n Sentinel Lymph Node Scintigraphy\\nAxillary lymph node status, a major prognostic factor in early-stage breast cancer, \\nprovides important information for individualized surgical treatment. Therefore, \\nsentinel lymph node biopsy is the standard surgical procedure for staging clinically \\ntumor-free regional nodes in patients with early-stage breast cancer. Axillary lymph \\nnode dissection is no longer recommended in these patients as it only adds to arm \\nmorbidity without conferring any prognostic or staging benefit [16]. Sentinel lymph \\nnode biopsy has become the standard of care for the primary treatment of early \\nbreast cancer and has replaced axillary lymph node dissection to stage clinically \\nnode-negative patients, thus reducing axillary lymph node dissection-associated \\nmorbidity.\\nSentinel lymph node biopsy is based on the notion that tumors drain in an orderly \\nmanner through the lymphatic system. Therefore, the sentinel lymph node is the \\nfirst to be affected by metastasis if the tumor has spread, and a tumor-free sentinel \\nlymph node suggests that it is highly unlikely that other nodes will be affected. \\nSentinel lymph node scintigraphy using radiolabeled colloids provides surgeons \\nwith a visual map to guide accurate localization of sentinel nodes and atypical \\n226 C. Turkmen\\ndrainage patterns. Although lymphoscintigraphy and sentinel lymph node biopsy \\nhave been used to stage many solid cancers, these procedures are most commonly \\nperformed in patients with breast cancer and melanoma. In the sentinel lymph node \\nbiopsy procedure, general recommendations require lymphoscintigraphy for quality \\ncontrol because it can improve accuracy (especially in extra-axillary lymph nodes) \\nand reduce surgical morbidity [17]. Lymphatic mapping reveals lymphatic ducts \\nand nodes and helps locate sentinel lymph nodes. SPECT/CT considerably improves \\nthe topographic localization of sentinel lymph nodes by providing more accurate \\nstaging of breast cancer patients. Intraoperative detection of sentinel lymph nodes is \\nusually radio guided by a γ-probe. Recently, several portable γ-cameras have been \\ndeveloped to provide an overview of radioactive “hot spots” in all surgical fields to \\nverify the completeness of sentinel lymph node excision. Recent developments \\ninclude combining conventional γ-probes with position and orientation tracking \\nsystems such as so-called free-hand SPECT, which permits virtual reconstruction in \\na 3-dimensional environment.\\nIdentification of the sentinel node is crucial to the success of sentinel lymph node \\nbiopsy, and with a detection rate between 94% and 100%, preoperative sentinel \\nnode imaging is ideally suited for this purpose [18–21]. Recent multi-institutional \\nstudies have revealed sentinel lymph node biopsy false-negative rates ranging from \\n5.5% to 16.7%, higher than the target set by the 2005 ASCO guidelines (<5%) [22, \\n23]. Unfortunately, sentinel lymph node biopsy remains an unstandardized proce-\\ndure surrounded by many unresolved controversies concerning the technique itself. \\nThe radiopharmaceuticals commonly used for sentinel lymph node biopsy are \\n99mTc-sulfur colloid (particle size, 15–5000\\xa0nm), 99mTc-nanocolloid (5–100\\xa0nm), \\nand 99mTc-antimony trisulfide (3–30\\xa0nm). There is general agreement that a radio-\\ncolloid measuring 100–200\\xa0nm should be considered the best compromise between \\nfast lymphatic drainage and optimal retention in sentinel lymph nodes [24]. The \\nliterature supports the use of small volumes (0.3–0.4\\xa0mL) with high specific activity \\nto improve sentinel lymph node detection. Currently, the criterion standard for sen-\\ntinel lymph node detection is based on use of radiotracer alone or in combination \\nwith blue dye, especially when the sentinel lymph node is suspected to be diffusely \\nmetastatic [25]. Currently, no clinical consensus exists on the optimal site of injec-\\ntion of the radioactive tracer or blue dye. Superficial (periareolar, subareolar, intra-\\ndermal, subdermal) and deep (peritumoral, intratumoral) injections within the breast \\nhave been reported widely for radioactive tracer administration [22, 26]. A recent \\nmeta-analysis comparing superficial and deep injections of radioactive tracer dem-\\nonstrated no significant difference between the two injection sites in the sentinel \\nlymph node identification rate on lymphoscintigraphy and during intraoperative \\nsentinel lymph node biopsy [27]. The rate of extra-axillary sentinel lymph node \\nidentification was significantly greater when deep rather than superficial injection \\nwas used (OR 3.00, 1.92–4.67).\\nSeveral contraindications for sentinel lymph node biopsy include grossly pal-\\npable nodes and inflammatory breast cancer. For some patients, sentinel lymph \\nnode biopsy may not be helpful because accurate sentinel lymph node removal \\nmay be challenging after prior surgery or radiation. Studies of inflammatory breast \\n8 Nuclear Medicine Imaging in\\xa0Breast Cancer 227\\ncancer report sentinel lymph node identification rates of only 80%–85% with a \\nrelatively high false negative rate (6.18%) [28]. Since the publication of the updated \\nASCO guidelines in 2017, no new data are available that support the benefit of \\nsentinel lymph node biopsy in women with large or locally advanced invasive \\nbreast cancers (T3/T4) and inflammatory breast cancer [29]. Sentinel lymph node \\nbiopsy is not recommended for women who have DCIS when surgery is planned. \\nSentinel lymph node biopsy is instead recommended for smaller tumors (T1 and \\nT2), multiple tumors, DCIS when mastectomy is planned, for older or obese \\npatients, in male patients with breast cancer, and in patients with prior breast or \\naxillary surgery. Sentinel lymph node biopsy may be offered before or after neoad-\\njuvant systemic therapy, but the procedure appears to be less accurate after neoad-\\njuvant systemic therapy.\\nToday, the prognostic relevance of isolated tumor cells and micrometastases is \\nnegligible. Two multi-institutional randomized studies demonstrated an identifica-\\ntion rate of sentinel lymph node biopsy of 98% in cN0 stage I/II breast cancer \\npatients [30, 31]. Thus, sentinel lymph node biopsy could prevent axillary lymph \\nnode dissection for sentinel lymph node-negative women. In the ACOSOG Z0010 \\ntrial, occult metastases were detected in 9% of cases, but no differences were \\nobserved in disease-free survival and overall survival [32]. The 10-year follow-up \\ndata of the NSABP B-32 trial, which demonstrated a prevalence of occult metasta-\\nses of 15.9%, revealed small differences in disease-free survival and overall survival \\nthat were statistically significant but not clinically significant. Therefore, complete \\naxillary lymph node dissection in cases of sentinel lymph node micrometastases is \\nno longer recommended [33].\\n Bone Scintigraphy\\nThe skeleton is the most common site for metastases from breast cancer. The skel-\\neton is affected in approximately 50%–70% of patients with relapse and is the only \\nmetastatic site of disease in 28%–44% of patients [34]. It is important to detect bone \\nmetastases at an early stage to minimize skeleton-related events and to allow the \\ndetermination of a response as early as possible to limit toxicity and accelerate the \\ntherapeutic transition in nonresponding patients. Imaging has always played a key \\nrole in the diagnosis of bone metastases in breast cancer, and planar 99mTc- \\ndiphosphonate bone scanning remains widely used. Its lack of specificity has been \\nimproved with the addition of SPECT and SPECT/CT. Despite improved accuracy \\nin staging of the skeleton, evidence of efficacy and consensus regarding effective \\nmonitoring of a treatment response are lacking. Although radiographs have been \\nused historically to determine a response by lesion resolution or sclerosis, this \\nmethod has been recognized as insensitive and may take at least 6\\xa0months to yield a \\nconfident assessment of a response. Abnormal accumulation of 99mTc-labeled \\ndiphosphonates is related to changes in\\xa0local blood flow and osteoblastic activity, \\nevents that are secondary in most bone metastases that are seeded in the bone \\n228 C. Turkmen\\nmarrow. The mechanism of accumulation means that the uptake of 99mTc-labeled \\ndiphosphonates is not specific for metastatic disease and may make the differentia-\\ntion of increased reparative osteoblastic activity after successful treatment (flare) \\nfrom unresponsive progressive disease impossible for several months. The problem \\nof the flare phenomenon, which makes the differentiation of progression from a \\ntemporary healing osteoblastic response to successful therapy difficult for \\n3–6\\xa0months, has also been recognized for many years and has been described after \\nchemotherapy and endocrine therapy in breast cancer [35]. Limitations with bone \\nscintigraphy are reported when measuring treatment response in breast cancer, with \\nonly 52% of responders showing scintigraphic improvement, and 62% of nonre-\\nsponders showing scintigraphic deterioration at 6–8\\xa0months [36].\\n Positron Emission Tomography/Computed Tomography\\nPositron emission tomography combined with computed tomography (PET/CT) has \\nreceived increasing attention in recent years for the diagnosis, staging and follow-up \\nof various malignancies. Positron emission tomography-computed tomography \\nwith 2-[fluorine-18]-fluoro-2-deoxy-d-glucose (FDG) has been established as an \\neffective modality for evaluation of cancer.\\nCurrently, PET is not used in breast cancer screening or in diagnosing primary \\nbreast cancer, mainly due to the high prevalence of false negative results, particu-\\nlarly for tumors with a diameter smaller than 1\\xa0cm and tumors with low metabolic \\nactivity. Inferior sensitivity of PET in primary breast cancer detection has been \\nreported compared to ultrasonography, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and \\nmammography [37]. The metabolic activity of breast tumors is variable. For exam-\\nple, invasive lobular breast cancer has a considerably lower 18F-FDG uptake than \\ninvasive ductal cancer does. The relatively high physiological glucose uptake in \\nsurrounding mammary tissue is another difficulty for the detection of tumors with \\nlow metabolic activity. The highest glucose uptake is observed for high-grade \\ntumors, triple-negative tumors (ER−, PgR−, HER2−) and inflammatory breast can-\\ncer [38, 39].\\nIn early-stage breast cancer with clinically negative axilla, 18F-FDG PET/CT is \\nnot recommended because its role is limited in the initial staging and treatment \\nplanning in most patients. In regional staging, 18F-FDG PET/CT is less sensitive \\nthan sentinel lymph node biopsy in assessing axillary lymph node involvement. The \\nlow prevalence of distant metastases and the risk of false-positive findings detract \\nfrom the usefulness of 18F-FDG PET/CT for distant staging in these patients [40]. In \\ncontrast, in patients with positive axilla, especially those with locally advanced \\nbreast cancer, 18F-FDG PET/CT can be useful prior to surgery or neoadjuvant che-\\nmotherapy, based on the high rate of detection of distant metastases, ranging from \\n6% to 26% [41]. The percentage of patients with extra-axillary lymph node involve-\\nment detected by PET/CT in\\xa0locally advanced breast cancer ranges from 10% to \\n29% [42, 43]. The superiority of 18F-FDG PET/CT with respect to conventional \\n8 Nuclear Medicine Imaging in\\xa0Breast Cancer 229\\na b c d e\\nFig. 8.1 A 54-year-old woman with ER−, PR−, and HER2-positive right breast invasive ductal \\ncarcinoma. PET coronal images demonstrate a corresponding FDG-avid mass consistent with the \\nknown carcinoma (a), metastatic lymph nodes in the right supraclavicular and axillary region (b, \\nc), a metastatic nodule in the apicoposterior segment of the left lung (d) and bone metastasis in the \\nsternum (e)\\nimaging for detecting extra-axillary lymph nodes and metastatic disease is more \\nrelevant in\\xa0locally advanced breast cancer (Fig.\\xa08.1). 18F-FDG PET/CT changes the \\ninitial treatment in 1%–8% of patients with early-stage breast cancer, in 7%–13% of \\nthose with locally advanced breast cancer and in up to 52% of those with more \\naggressive tumors, such as inflammatory breast cancer [44, 45].\\nIn addition to staging, the level of 18F-FDG uptake by a primary tumor has prog-\\nnostic value in many types of cancer. With respect to the semiquantitative informa-\\ntion from 18F-FDG PET/CT, the prognostic impact of the glycolytic activity \\n(SUVmax) of the primary breast tumor is controversial. Whereas some authors \\nfound no association between tumor 18F-FDG uptake and prognosis [46, 47], others \\nreported that patients with high tumor uptake had worse outcomes [48, 49]. \\nFurthermore, a single and reproducible SUVmax has not been established; cutoff \\nvalues range from 3 to 6. The evidence for the prognostic value of SUVmax in axil-\\nlary lymph nodes is also limited, although higher values have been associated with \\nhigher recurrence rates [50, 51].\\nChanges in tumor metabolic activity have been shown to be an early indicator of \\ntreatment effectiveness for breast cancer, mainly in the neoadjuvant setting. A \\ndecrease in tumor metabolic activity offers both assessment of the treatment \\nresponse after the completion of therapy and early prediction of therapeutic effec-\\ntiveness after the first or second cycle of chemotherapy. Identifying nonresponding \\npatients on the basis of changes in tumor metabolic activity early during treatment \\ncould facilitate a change from an ineffective to a more effective treatment approach. \\nRousseau et\\xa0al. studied 64 stage II and III breast cancer patients at multiple cycles \\nduring neoadjuvant chemotherapy and found a marked decrease in 18F-FDG uptake \\nin nearly all patients who achieved a greater than 50% therapeutic effect [52]. \\nPerforming 18F-FDG PET after the second cycle of treatment potentially provides a \\nmore accurate prediction of treatment response. Using a 40% decrease in the SUV, \\n230 C. Turkmen\\nRousseau et\\xa0al. identified a negative predictive value of 68% for identifying nonre-\\nsponders after the first cycle; this value increased to 85% after the second cycle. \\nSchwarz-Dose et\\xa0 al. confirmed in 104 patients that the greater the reduction in \\ntumor metabolic activity early during neoadjuvant treatment, the more likely the \\npatients would achieve a pathologic response [53]. After the first cycle of chemo-\\ntherapy, tumor metabolic activity decreased by 50%\\xa0±\\xa018% in pathologic respond-\\ners; in comparison, the decrease in pathologic nonresponders was 36%\\xa0±\\xa020%. Of \\nnote, all breast carcinomas (23%) with a baseline SUV less than 3.0 did not respond \\nto chemotherapy. A recent meta-analysis including 19 studies with more than 900 \\npatients found that the best cutoff for a response was a decrease in 18F-FDG uptake \\nranging from 55% to 65% [54]. Although the sensitivity and specificity for identify-\\ning patients responding to treatment were limited (84% and 66%, respectively), the \\nnegative predictive value for identifying nonresponders was high (91%).\\nChanges in the sizes of bone metastases are particularly difficult to evaluate \\nwith conventional imaging as sclerotic lesions do not disappear and lytic lesions \\ncan show sclerotic changes as an indicator of a treatment response (Fig.\\xa08.2). Two \\nstudies demonstrated a high sensitivity of 18F-FDG PET/CT for the detection of \\nosseous metastases in patients with newly diagnosed metastatic breast cancer, and \\nthe metabolic activity of osseous breast cancer metastases provided prognostic \\ninformation [55, 56]. In a retrospective analysis, bone metastases in 102 patients \\na b c\\nd e f\\nFig. 8.2 A 64-year-old woman with a history of left invasive ductal cancer, status postmastectomy, \\nimaged for surveillance. 18F-FDG PET-CT images showed sclerotic bone metastasis in the thoracic \\nvertebrae (a), which demonstrated mild FDG uptake on the fused (b) and PET images (c). After \\nchemotherapy, while there was no chance of a sclerotic component of lesion on CT images (d), \\nfused (e) and PET/CT (f)\\xa0images showed decreased metabolic activity corresponding to therapeu-\\ntic response at the same location\\n8 Nuclear Medicine Imaging in\\xa0Breast Cancer 231\\nwere assessed with 18F-FDG PET/CT before and after treatment, and a decrease in \\n18F-FDG uptake was a significant predictor of response duration in univariate and \\nmultivariate analyses [57].\\nThe early detection and accurate restaging of recurrent breast cancer are of sig-\\nnificant importance for applying optimal therapeutic strategies to achieve better \\nprognosis and lower mortality. For breast cancer with suspicious recurrence, how-\\never, there is no standard follow-up protocol to date, and further examination of \\nradiologic imaging, such as CT, bone scintigraphy, MRI, and PET, may be needed. \\n18F-FDG-PET or PET/CT is a valuable technique for acquiring functional informa-\\ntion for early detection of whole-body multifocal malignant lesions and enables the \\ndiagnosis of missed or incorrect recurrence offered by conventional imaging modal-\\nities. Because it allows better discrimination between posttreatment scar or fibrosis \\nand viable tumor tissue, PET/CT is efficient for detecting locoregional recurrence, \\nespecially in the chest wall, axilla, and extraaxillary lymph nodes basins, with better \\nperformance than CT or MRI. A recent meta-analysis systematically summarized \\nthe overall diagnostic value of 18F-FDG PET or PET/CT for the diagnosis of recur-\\nrence in suspicious breast cancer. The pooled sensitivity was 0.90 (95% CI: 0.88–\\n0.92), indicating a higher capacity for PET analysis in the early detection of \\nrecurrent breast cancer [58]. In addition, the pooled specificity was 0.81 (95% CI: \\n0.78–0.84), demonstrating a relatively higher ability to exclude recurrence in suspi-\\ncious breast cancer compared with other imaging modalities, such as CT or MRI. In \\nother words, a negative PET result can indicate the absence of recurrent breast can-\\ncer with 81% probability.\\n18F-NaF is a positron emitter that is used for bone imaging. The mechanism of \\nuptake is quite similar to those of 99mTc-MDP and 18F-NaF.\\xa0Chemisorption of 18F- \\nNaF to hydroxyapatite results in conversion to fluoroapatite and a hydroxyl group. \\nStudies comparing the utility of 18F-NaF PET/CT with 99mTc-MDP whole-body \\nbone scintigraphy have shown that 18F-NaF PET/CT generally has higher sensitiv-\\nity and specificity than bone scan. The higher uptake of 18F-NaF compared to \\n99mTc- MDP in the skeleton and faster blood clearance yield a better target/back-\\nground ratio in a shorter time period. Factors contributing to the success of 18F-NaF \\nPET/CT include the following: 18F-NaF uptake in both lytic and blastic metastasis, \\nsectional imaging advantages for the whole body and easy detection of small \\nlesions due to the improved resolution of PET technology, and better visualization \\nof bone marrow lesions [59]. In addition to 18F-FDG and 18F-NaF, other radiophar-\\nmaceuticals have been used in both pre-clinical and clinical settings in breast can-\\ncer. Radiolabeled hypoxia-avid compounds such as 18F-labeled fluoromisonidazole \\nor 18F-FMISO can be used to evaluate oxygenation status in experimental or human \\ntumors. This PET radiotracer has affinity for hypoxic cells with functional nitrore-\\nductase enzymes; therefore, it accumulates in activated cells but not in necrotic \\ncells. 18F-labeled fluorothymidine, or 18F-FLT, has been proposed as an early \\nmolecular imaging biomarker able to evaluate treatment response with taxanes \\n[60]. The uptake of FLT is also correlated with the Ki-67 labeling index, another \\nproliferation parameter, in breast cancer. Some studies have presented a strong cor-\\nrelation of FLT uptake with cell proliferation in untreated patients with breast cancer, \\n232 C. Turkmen\\nenabling detection of response as early as 1\\xa0week after chemotherapy. Pio et\\xa0al. \\ncompared 18F-FDG and 18F-FLT imaging in 14 patients with newly diagnosed pri-\\nmary or metastatic breast cancer for monitoring and predicting tumor response to \\nchemotherapy [61]. The group concluded that 18F-FLT may be more accurate than \\n18F-FDG 2\\xa0weeks after the end of the first course of chemotherapy for predicting \\nlonger-term efficacy of chemotherapy for women with breast cancer. 18F-labeled \\nfluoroestradiol or 18F-FES is a novel radiopharmaceutical that non-invasively mea-\\nsures ER expression in tumors and has emerged as a valuable method for predict-\\ning response to hormone therapy in recurrent or metastatic breast cancer patients \\n[62, 63]. The level of 18F-FES uptake predicts the likelihood of a response to \\ntamoxifen and aromatase inhibitor treatment, as supported by some studies, and \\ncould be of use in assessing the treatment response in groups with recurrent or \\nmetastatic breast cancer [64].\\n Positron Emission Tomography/Magnetic Resonance Imaging\\nPET/MR imaging is particularly interesting as a possible improvement over PET/\\nCT oncologic whole-body imaging because MR imaging provides improved \\nlesion detection in the brain, breast, liver, kidneys, and bones compared with \\nCT.\\xa0In focused breast and whole-body settings, PET/MR imaging can bring meta-\\nbolic, anatomic, spectroscopic, and diffusion- and perfusion-based data together \\nin a single examination. In whole-body imaging for breast cancer, PET/MR imag-\\ning has been shown to provide improved sensitivity over PET/CT, particularly for \\nbreast cancers, liver metastases, and bone metastases [65, 66]. In local staging, \\nPET and MR imaging appear to be complimentary, with MR imaging providing \\ngreater accuracy for satellite lesions and PET providing greater sensitivity for \\naxillary nodes. PET/MR imaging has been shown to be more likely than PET/CT \\nto determine the correct maximum diameter of the tumor (T stage), which may be \\nuseful in surgical and oncologic planning [67]. In imaging metastatic disease, \\nPET and MR imaging are again complimentary, with MR imaging providing \\nhigh\\xa0 sensitivity and PET tempering the relatively low specificity of diffusion-\\nweighted imaging (DWI).\\xa0PET/MR imaging has also been shown to detect brain \\nmetastases.\\nWhen separated out by sequence, dynamic contrast-enhanced (DCE) MR imag-\\ning has been shown to be most useful for breast and brain lesions, DWI has been \\nshown to be most useful for liver and bone metastases, and PET has been shown to \\nbe most useful for lymph node metastases [66]. These variable strengths highlight \\nthe advantage of multimodality imaging. In particular, combining PET and DWI \\nmay be important because PET has been shown to greatly improve the specificity of \\nDWI in whole-body imaging [68]. In addition, omitting whole-body CT from the \\nPET examination can decrease the radiation dose by half [66]. These data suggest a \\nwider role for PET/MR imaging in breast cancer staging and surveillance, particu-\\nlarly in young patients and in patients undergoing serial examinations.\\n8 Nuclear Medicine Imaging in\\xa0Breast Cancer 233\\n Conclusion\\nThe general advantage of nuclear medicine imaging is that tumor-seeking radio-\\npharmaceuticals accumulate in cancer lesions, which makes scintimammography \\nand PET fundamentally different from radiological techniques that image the tumor \\nmainly on the basis of morphological alterations. Scintimammography is indicated \\nfor the study of breast lesions in patients in whom mammography or MRI is non- \\ndiagnostic or difficult to interpret; it may also be useful for assessing and even pre-\\ndicting the response to chemotherapy. Although whole-body FDG PET imaging \\ndoes not have sufficient utility in the detection of primary disease and is not opti-\\nmized to replace the sentinel lymph node procedure for initial axillary staging, FDG \\nPET scanning has efficacy superior to that of conventional imaging for the detection \\nof locoregional and metastatic spread in the appropriate patient population and has \\nbetter diagnostic performance for the detection of skeletal metastasis compared \\nwith routine bone scanning. The major roles for PET/CT in breast cancer are detec-\\ntion and localization of metastasis, monitoring the response to treatment and early \\ndetection of recurrence. On the basis of the abovementioned evidence, nuclear med-\\nicine techniques, integrated with radiological techniques, offer an interesting oppor-\\ntunity to improve the diagnostic imaging yield in breast cancer, which will eventually \\nlead to better patient management.\\nReferences\\n 1.

The common denominator in \\nthese studies is the significant association of complete pathologic response with not \\nonly breast conservation but also a prominent improvement in odds of survival rang-\\ning between 50% and 67% [5–8]. Consequently, the ultimate goal of induction treat-\\nment has been to improve pathologic complete response (pCR) rates with different \\ncombinations administered at variable schedules. The incorporation of taxanes has \\nresulted in higher pCR rates ranging between 18% and 34%, with the range depen-\\ndent on the biology of the tumor. Nevertheless, we have unfortunately reached a \\nplateau in response rates, despite utilization of further strategies such as dose-dense \\nregimens or the incorporation of newer agents such as capecitabine, vinorelbine or \\ngemcitabine in combinations, even when used as part of a response-a dopted approach \\n[7–9]. Data from these trials and others have suggested that an early clinical response \\nto treatment may also be used to predict a higher probability of pCR at surgery. The \\nmain objective of predefining a pCR is to select the best chemotherapy regimen for a \\ngiven patient. This would also enable treating physicians to switch to better regimens \\nearly in the course of treatment and prevent unnecessary toxicity from an ineffective \\ncombination. In other words, by using a “patient-tailored” approach, it would be \\nhypothetically possible to improve the chance of pCR, which may ultimately lead to \\nan improvement in survival. Some clinicopathological variables, such as a lack of \\nhormone receptors and a high grade, have already been shown to be associated with \\nY.

Energetic efforts to identify \\nmolecular determinants or groups of genetic variables in specific patterns, namely, \\nthe “genetic signatures” of response, are in their early stages of development, and as \\nof yet there is no reliable predictor of pCR.\\nThe main advantage of preoperative systemic treatment is the incorporation of \\ngenomic analyses in the clinical setting, thereby enabling studies of the molecu-\\nlar predictors of response to a given treatment and providing insight into the \\nbiology of the tumor. In fact, to carry this approach one step further, recent neo-\\nadjuvant trials have focused on investigating the role of various biological agents \\nin treating distinct biological subgroups before confirmation by larger-scale \\nadjuvant trials.\\n Basic Considerations\\n Pathologic Complete Response\\nRandomized trials have provided substantial and consistent evidence of a positive \\ncorrelation with pCR and outcome, as summarized in Table\\xa09.1. Therefore, pCR \\nhas been universally accepted as the primary endpoint in nearly all neoadjuvant \\ntrials. However, the definition of pCR remains somewhat controversial, and there \\nappears to be substantial heterogeneity in this definition across different trials, \\nleading to difficulty in comparing outcomes. As summarized in Table\\xa09.2, defini-\\ntions range from no invasive disease in the breast only to no invasive or non-inva-\\nsive tumor deposits in the breast and lymph nodes (ypT0N0). Most of these \\ndefinitions have shown a significant association with disease-free survival (DFS) or \\noverall survival (OS). In a meta-analysis of seven neoadjuvant German trials \\nincluding data from 3332 patients, no invasive or non-invasive residuals in both the \\nbreast and lymph nodes was the most sensitive definition of pCR predicting a better \\noutcome in terms of OS and DFS [21]. These data conflict with the most recent \\nmeta-analysis reporting individual patient data from 12 large randomized trials, \\nTable 9.1 Pathologic complete response classification systems and correlations with outcome\\nOutcome \\nAuthor/group pCR definition correlation\\nFisher/NSABP [8] Breast: no invasive tumor OS; DFS\\nKuerer/MD Anderson CC [7] Breast and lymph nodes: no invasive tumor OS; DFS\\nPierga/Institut Curie [10] Breast and lymph nodes: no invasive tumor OS; DFS\\nVan der Hage/EORTC [2] Breast and lymph nodes: no malignant cells OS\\nOgston/Aberdeen [11] Breast: no invasive tumor OS; DFS\\nVon Minckwitz/GBCSG [12] Breast and lymph nodes: no invasive or OS; DFS\\nnon-invasive tumor\\npCR pathologic complete response, OS overall survival, DFS disease-free survival\\n9 Preoperative Systemic Therapy for\\xa0Operable Breast Cancer 243\\nTable 9.2 Survival outcomes of neoadjuvant chemotherapy and pathologic complete response \\nrates\\npCR pCR DFS, EFS \\nAuthor Regimen (%) site P (%) p OS (%) p\\nAberdeen CVAP 16 B 77 84\\n[13] CVAP-D 34 0.034 90 (3-yr 0.03 97 (3-yr 0.05\\nDFS) OS)\\nAGO [6] EP 10 BL 50 77\\nE-P 18 0.008 70 (5-yr 0.011 83 (5-yr 0.04\\nDFS) OS)\\nSICOG [14] EP q3 wk 6 BL 55 69\\nEPCis q wk 16 0.02 73 (5-yr 0.04 82 (5-yr 0.07\\nDMFS) OS)\\nNOAH [15] AP-P-CMF 19 BL 56 79\\nAP-P- 38 0.001 71 (3-yr 0.013 87 (3-yr NS\\nCMF\\xa0+\\xa0Trastz EFS) OS)\\nNSABP AC-surgery 13 BL 59 74\\nB-27 [5] AC-surgery-D 14.5 62 75\\nAC-D-surgery 26 <0.001 62 (8-yr NS 75 (8-yr NS\\nDFS) OS)\\nACCOG AC 16 BL NA NA\\n[16] AD 12 NS NS NS\\nMDA [17] CAF 8 BL 89 NA\\nP 17 NS 94 (2-yr NS NS\\nDFS)\\nBaldni [18] CED 2.6 BL 48 52\\ndd CEF 4.1 NS 60 (5-yr NS 54 (5-yr NS\\nDFS) OS)\\nTOPIC [19] AC 25 BL 63 74\\nECisF 24 NS 62 (5-yr NS 82 (5-yr NS\\nRFS) OS)\\nTOPIC 2 AC 12 BL\\n[20] VE 12 NS HR: 1.18 NS HR: 1.41 NS\\n(2-yr DFS) (2-yr OS)\\npCR pathologic response rate, dd dose-dense, Cis cisplatin, AC adriamycin-cyclophosphamide, \\nD\\xa0 docetaxel, EC epirubicin-cyclophosphamide, CEF fluorouracil-epirubicin-cyclophosphamide, \\nED epirubicin-docetaxel, CED cyclophosphamide-epirubicin-docetaxel, AP adriamycin-pacli-\\ntaxel, D\\xa0docetaxel, CVAP cyclophosphamide-vincristine-adriamycin-prednisolone, VE vincristine- \\nepirubicin, wk week, B breast, BL breast and lymph nodes, yr year, OS overall survival, DFS \\ndisease- free survival, RFS relapse-free survival, DMFS distant metastasis-free survival\\np\\xa0<\\xa00.05 denotes statistically significant difference, NS not significant\\nwhich showed that the presence of in situ carcinoma in the breast does not influence \\nthe favorable effect of pCR on OS [hazard ratio (HR) ypT0ypN0 vs ypT0/isypN0 \\nvs ypT0/is: 0.36, 0.36 vs 0.51, respectively].

Eralp\\n Predictive Biomarkers\\nWith the evolution of molecular and genetic testing in modern oncology, numer-\\nous multi-gene signatures with potential predictive and prognostic roles have \\nbeen identified. However, correlative validation studies have shown that these \\nclassifiers not only are associated with substantially different outcomes but also \\ndisplay a wide variation in response to standard chemotherapy regimens. \\nNevertheless, trials evaluating the role of biomarkers have consistently con-\\ncluded that tumors with a high proliferative capacity as assessed by a high Ki-67 \\nlevel or grade, hormone receptor negativity or HER-2 positivity display a high \\nprobability of response and a higher chance of survival in those with a \\npCR.\\xa0Although, molecular tests specifically developed to predict pCR have not \\ndemonstrated any predictive superiority over the combination of standard clini-\\ncopathological parameters (ER status, grade, and age), there are emerging data \\nthat some tests that have been compared with a survival endpoint may have a role \\nin identifying patients who may or may not benefit from chemotherapy. A retro-\\nspective evaluation of gene expression profiling data from eight studies including \\n996 patients revealed that the addition of an immunogenic genomic module to \\nclinical characteristics significantly increased the accuracy in predicting pCR in \\nthe HER-2 subgroup [12]. In the remaining intrinsic subgroups as assessed by \\nthe PAM50 assay, there were no specific genomic signatures that would identify \\npatients who would benefit from standard neoadjuvant chemotherapy. I-SPY, a \\nmulti-center trial reported recently, prospectively evaluated the role of multi-\\ngene classifiers as well as standard pathological biomarkers in 237 patients \\ntreated with neoadjuvant anthracycline and taxane-based chemotherapy [23]. \\nThis trial confirmed the general consensus that highly proliferative tumors \\nrespond better to chemotherapy as pCR rates were approximately 5–9% for lumi-\\nnal A tumors or those with a low Ki-67 level, as well as those with low-risk \\ngenomic profiles (ROR- S, wound healing signature, PAM-50, 70-gene classi-\\nfier). By contrast, high-risk and HER-2-positive tumors showed pCR rates of \\n35% and 54%, respectively [23, 24]. In terms of outcome, patients with luminal \\nor low-risk tumors had longer survival rates but lower pCR rates, as also reported \\nin a meta-analysis of individual patient data across 12 large randomized neoad-\\njuvant trials and the recently reported GEPARTRIO trial [22, 25]. As expected, \\nfor higher-risk patients, pCR improved the chances for a better outcome. In mul-\\ntivariate analysis, most molecular signatures and clinical stages improved the \\nability to predict RFS, suggesting that molecular classifiers can identify patients \\nwith a favorable prognostic profile among the non- pCR hormone receptor-positive \\nsubtypes. The wound-healing signature was the most accurate classifier in iden-\\ntifying lower-risk patients, consistent with previous studies suggesting that the \\ntumor microenvironment and inflammatory response may have relevant roles in \\nthe pathogenesis of breast cancer.\\n9 Preoperative Systemic Therapy for\\xa0Operable Breast Cancer 245\\n Response-Guided Treatment\\nAccurate early-response assessment during chemotherapy is an important part of \\nthe neoadjuvant treatment strategy to identify patients who are unlikely to benefit \\nfrom the given regimen. There are substantial data from randomized trials showing \\na strong correlation between achieving pCR and favorable long-term survival, as \\nsummarized previously in this chapter. As expected, a poor or minimal response \\nusually suggests a poorer outcome. Numerous neoadjuvant trials have evaluated the \\nrole of early response to standard chemotherapy regimens in selecting subsequent \\nnon-cross-resistant agents. An earlier study by the MD Anderson group randomized \\npatients with a larger than 1\\xa0 cm2 residual tumor burden following five cycles of \\nanthracycline-based combination to either five more cycles of the same regimen or \\nto 5\\xa0cycles of a different combination including vinblastine, methotrexate and fluo-\\nrouracil [26]. Despite the limited sample size, there was a trend for survival advan-\\ntage for patients treated with the alternative regimen (p\\xa0=\\xa00.08). Contradicting this \\ndata, the TAX 301 Aberdeen Trial showed no advantage in switching to docetaxel in \\npatients who were unresponsive to four cycles of an anthracycline-based combina-\\ntion [13]. Nevertheless, there was a significant increase in the pCR rate (31% vs \\n15%) when responding patients received four more cycles of docetaxel, which \\ntranslated into a survival advantage in these pathologically complete responding \\npatients. The recently reported GEPARTRIO trial, which included 2090 patients \\nwho initially received two cycles of the docetaxel/doxorubicin/cyclophosphamide \\n(TAC) regimen, randomized non-responding patients to six more cycles of the same \\nregimen or to two cycles of TAC, followed by four cycles of the vinorelbine and \\ncapecitabine combination [27]. Although an earlier report failed to show an advan-\\ntage in terms of pCR in the experimental group, an updated analysis suggested a \\nsignificant survival advantage favoring response-guided treatment that was limited \\nto patients in the luminal A and luminal B subgroups [25, 27]. The results of this \\nstudy highlight the fact that in patients with hormone receptor-positive tumors, pCR \\nmay not be a good surrogate endpoint for survival because these patients receive the \\nmost effective regimen in the adjuvant setting. Despite accumulating data suggest-\\ning that neoadjuvant chemotherapy may be tailored according to the response early \\nduring the course of treatment, some questions remain to be resolved before adop-\\ntion as a standard approach.\\n Chemotherapy Regimens\\nThe significant survival advantage achieved by adjuvant chemotherapy demon-\\nstrated in earlier studies led to trials investigating the role of neoadjuvant chemo-\\ntherapy toward the end of the last century.

[28], who showed a significant improvement in overall survival with neoadju-\\nvant doxorubicin and vincristine combination administered before irradiation com-\\npared to radiation alone in locally advanced breast cancer. Pivotal trials investigating \\nthe role of PSC basically compared four to eight cycles of anthracycline-b ased regi-\\nmens given as neoadjuvant versus adjuvant treatment in patients with operable clini-\\ncal T1-3N0-1 disease [1, 2, 4]. None of these trials were able to show a difference \\nin outcomes between these approaches, as summarized in Table\\xa09.3.\\n One Step Higher to\\xa0Improved Response Rates: Integration \\nof\\xa0Newer-Generation Agents\\n Taxanes\\nEncouraged by the favorable results achieved in the adjuvant setting, taxanes were \\nswiftly incorporated in anthracycline-based combinations in the hope of improving \\nresponse rates in the neoadjuvant setting. As anticipated, taxanes resulted in higher \\npathologic complete response rates compared to non-taxane regimens. The largest \\nof these trials was NSABP B-27, which randomized 2411 patients with operable \\nbreast cancer to four cycles of AC alone, four cycles of AC followed by four cycles \\nof docetaxel before surgery, or four cycles of neoadjuvant AC followed by surgery \\n9 Preoperative Systemic Therapy for\\xa0Operable Breast Cancer 247\\nand four cycles of adjuvant docetaxel [3]. The significantly increased pCR rate \\n(14% vs 26%, p\\xa0>\\xa00.001) compared to the standard referent regimen and manage-\\nable toxicity profile set AC followed by docetaxel as the state-of-the-art approach in \\nthe neoadjuvant setting. Nevertheless, despite a nearly twofold increase in the pCR \\nrate, the B-27 trial failed to show a significant difference in overall survival, possi-\\nbly related to the inadequate sample size, which lacked sufficient power to detect a \\nsmall expected improvement of 3–5%, as seen in adjuvant taxane trials [5].\\nThe favorable impact of taxanes on response rates is summarized in Table\\xa09.4. \\nOverall, these trials have shown that six to eight cycles of anthracycline and \\ntaxane- based combinations, either in sequence or given concomitantly, yield \\nhigher pathologic complete response rates compared to non-taxane-based regi-\\nmens. In trials that have evaluated the role of dose-dense chemotherapy, the \\nresponse rate was not demonstrated to be substantially higher compared to stan-\\ndard dose regimens. In fact, the PREPARE trial, which investigated the role of a \\ndose-dense regimen incorporating anthracyclines, taxanes and alkylating agents, \\nshowed that despite the higher pCR rate (21% vs 14%), outcomes in terms of \\nDFS (3\\xa0year 75.8 vs 78.8%) and OS (3\\xa0year 88.4 vs 91.8%) were not different \\n[35].

The \\nGEPARQUATTRO trial, which is the largest in sample size, randomized 1495 \\npatients with T1-4N0-3M0 patients to single-agent docetaxel, sequential docetaxel \\nand capecitabine or concomitant docetaxel and capecitabine following four cycles \\nof epirubicin/cyclophosphamide (EC) [36]. The study failed to show a significant \\nimprovement in pCR rates, and there was a higher rate of serious non-hematological \\ntoxicity with the combination. Similarly, a phase III trial by the Austrian Breast and \\nColorectal Study Group (ABCSG-24) revealed no difference between a triplet com-\\nbination of epirubicin, docetaxel and capecitabine and the doublet [37]. Furthermore, \\nin the NSABP B-40 trial, investigators reported a 29.7% pCR rate for the combina-\\ntion of docetaxel and capecitabine, which was somewhat lower than that for single- \\nagent docetaxel (32.7%) [38].\\nDespite discouraging data from single studies and a recent meta-analysis of \\npooled data [39], a meta-analysis including individual patient data of 966 patients \\nfrom German neoadjuvant trials suggested a significantly increased rate of pCR \\nwith a hazard ratio of 1.62 by multivariate analysis (p\\xa0=\\xa00.02) [21].\\nUntil further data from ongoing trials including triple-negative patients are \\nreported, there appears to be no role for incorporating capecitabine in standard \\nanthracycline- and taxane-based neoadjuvant chemotherapy regimens.\\n Gemcitabine\\nGemcitabine has established activity when combined with paclitaxel in patients \\nwith advanced breast cancer. Preliminary data from the first randomized trial testing \\nthe role of this combination in the neoadjuvant setting failed to detect an advantage \\nin terms of pCR compared to single-agent paclitaxel following four cycles of the EC \\nregimen [40]. Similarly, the addition of gemcitabine to docetaxel yielded a lower \\npCR rate (31.8%) compared to docetaxel (32.7%) in the NSABP B-40 trial [38]. In \\nconclusion, there exists no evidence supporting a role for adding gemcitabine in the \\nneoadjuvant setting.\\n Vinorelbine\\nThere are limited data on the role of vinorelbine in the neoadjuvant setting. In a \\nconsiderably resistant patient population, a vinorelbine and capecitabine combina-\\ntion yielded a pCR rate of 6%, which was not different than that observed for the \\n9 Preoperative Systemic Therapy for\\xa0Operable Breast Cancer 249\\nstandard TAC combination [27]. In another phase III trial, the epirubicin-v inorelbine \\ncombination resulted in similar pCR (12%) and mastectomy rates as found for \\nAC\\xa0 [20]. Based on these data, there seems to be no role for vinorelbine in the \\nneoadjuvant\\xa0setting.\\n Nano-Albumin-Bound Paclitaxel (nab-Pac)\\nFollowing approval of this agent for first-line treatment for those progressing within \\n6\\xa0months of adjuvant chemotherapy or second-line treatment of metastatic breast \\ncancer, numerous phase II studies investigated the role of nab-Pac for earlier dis-\\nease. However, almost all of these studies used this agent in combination with car-\\nboplatin and bevacizumab, which yielded encouraging response rates, especially in \\nthe triple-negative subgroup, of 53–59% [41–43].\\nA phase III study that evaluated the role of nab-Pac in the neoadjuvant setting \\nwas recently reported [44]. In the GEPARSEPTO trial, 1204 patients were random-\\nized to two arms: standard paclitaxel weekly at 80\\xa0mg/m2 for 12\\xa0weeks or nab-Pac \\nweekly at 150\\xa0mg/m2 for 12\\xa0weeks followed by four cycles of EC.\\xa0Patients with \\nHer-2-positive disease received pertuzumab and trastuzumab throughout the treat-\\nment period (n:400). Use of nab-paclitaxel resulted in a significant benefit in the \\nwhole patient group, with an absolute 9% incremental improvement in the pCR rate \\n(pCR: 38% vs 29%, p\\xa0<\\xa00.001). A planned subgroup analysis showed a significantly \\nimproved pCR rate of 48.2% in the triple-negative subgroup (n:275 patients), with \\na hazard ratio of 2.69 (p\\xa0<\\xa00.001) and a trend for an improved 4-year DFS rate (78% \\nvs 68%; HR:0.66; 95% CI: 0.42–1.04) [45]. Nevertheless, the 25.7% pCR rate of \\nthe standard arm in the triple-negative group is considerably lower than previously \\nreported pCR rates for similar combinations, including 34.5% in the GEPARSIXTO \\ntrial and 41% in the CALGB 40603 trials [46, 47]. However, as a subgroup analysis, \\nthis result should be regarded with caution; based on the favorable outcome in the \\nadvanced setting, it would seem feasible to use this agent in the absence of effective \\ntargeted regimens. Nevertheless, it should be noted that further confirmatory data \\nare required to establish the role of nab-Paclitaxel for triple-negative breast cancer.\\n Carboplatin\\nThe role of carboplatin as neoadjuvant treatment was evaluated in the context of tri-\\nple-negative and Her-2 positive breast cancer. In triple-negative disease, a small \\nphase II trial [48] failed to show a benefit with carboplatin added to docetaxel com-\\npared to single-agent docetaxel following four cycles of a standard anthracycline-\\nbased combination, whereas two larger randomized trials [46, 47] yielded significantly \\nhigher pCR rates, with increments of 13–16% (Table\\xa09.5). Notably, both of these \\ntrials also incorporated bevacizumab as part of the combination regimens. \\nFurthermore, a subgroup analysis in the GEPARSIXTO trial revealed that the addi-\\ntion of carboplatin provided benefit, regardless of the germline BRCA mutation \\n250 Y.

In the triple-negative subgroup of the recently reported \\nGerman Adapt trial, which incorporates a risk-adapted neoadjuvant strategy, 4\\xa0cycles \\nof a nab-pac and carboplatin combination yielded a significantly improved pCR rate \\ncompared to four cycles of nab-pac and gemcitabine (45.9% vs 28.7%, p\\xa0<\\xa00.001) \\n[51]. Although germline BRCA status has not been consistently linked with response \\nto platin-based chemotherapy, there is clinical evidence suggesting that somatic \\nmutations in the BRCA gene or the homologous repair pathway (HRD) may be \\npotentially associated with platin responsiveness. A validation study from a pooled \\nanalysis of three neoadjuvant studies including triple-negative patients demonstrated \\nthat tumors with a high HRD score were more likely to achieve pCR (53% vs 18%) \\nwith a hazard ratio of 4.64 (p\\xa0<\\xa00.0001) irrespective of BRCA status [52]. In light of \\nthe data showing significantly improved response rates, it would be reasonable to use \\nplatin-based regimens in triple-negative patients, who otherwise lack effective treat-\\nment options. The future of triple-negative disease holds promise as results from tri-\\nals incorporating biomarker-driven strategies, including PARP inhibitors and PD-1 \\ninhibitor-based combinations, are awaited with enthusiasm.\\nIn Her-2-positive disease, the role of carboplatin as part of a non-anthracycline- \\nbased regimen combined with dual blockade (TCH-Lapatinib and TCH-Pertuzumab) \\nwas investigated in two phase II trials, which each yielded pCR rates of 52% [53, 54]. \\nFollowing encouraging response rates, especially in hormone receptor-negative \\npatients, the TCHP regimen was further evaluated in two phase III trials. In the \\nTRAIN-II trial, 27\\xa0weeks of this combination was compared to a standard anthracy-\\ncline- and taxane-based combination with a similar total duration. Overall, the pCR \\nrates were similar in both arms (68% vs 67%, NS), including in hormone receptor \\n(HR)-positive patients (55 vs 51%; NS). Nevertheless, the numerically higher pCR \\nrate in HR-negative patients (84% vs 89%; NS) led to concerns regarding omission of \\nanthracyclines in this subset [55]. Furthermore, in the phase III KRISTINE trial, the \\nstandard TCHP arm yielded a 56% pCR rate, in concordance with previous results \\nutilizing the same regimen and confirming the efficacy of this combination [56]. \\nWhen we put these data in context, non-anthracycline-based combinations incorpo-\\nrating carboplatin with taxanes, in addition to pertuzumab-based dual Her-2 blockade, \\nhave shown favorable pCR rates and should be considered in all patients who are \\neligible for neoadjuvant treatment, especially in those with cardiac comorbidities. In \\n9 Preoperative Systemic Therapy for\\xa0Operable Breast Cancer 251\\nHR-negative patients, who are considered to harbor high-risk disease, omission of \\nanthracyclines remains a matter of debate, and the decision should be individualized. \\nThe role of dual Her-2 blockade within the context of neoadjuvant treatment is further \\ndiscussed in detail below.\\n Biological Agents\\n Her-2-Targeting Agents\\n Trastuzumab\\nTrastuzumab-based combinations have opened a new era for the treatment of early- \\nand advanced-stage Her-2-positive breast cancer. One of the earlier studies in the \\nneoadjuvant setting was a small randomized pilot trial in operable patients that \\nshowed a pCR of 65.2% [57]. This unprecedented pCR rate has been confirmed by \\nsubsequent larger randomized trials that evaluated the role of trastuzumab as part of \\nstandard anthracycline- and taxane-based regimens. One of these, the NOAH trial, \\nhad a unique design that allowed the concomitant use of anthracycline and trastu-\\nzumab. In that trial, the combination regimen yielded a pCR rate of 38% and a \\n5-year EFS of 71% in the HER-2-positive patient subset, significantly higher than \\npCR rate of 19% (p\\xa0=\\xa00.001) and EFS rate of 56% (p\\xa0=\\xa00.013) in the control arm. \\nThe updated data after a median follow-up period of 5.4\\xa0years showed a significant \\nadvantage in terms of overall survival, with a hazard ratio of 0.66 (p\\xa0=\\xa00.05) [15]. In \\nterms of cardiac toxicity, there were no differences with respect to grade 3 and 4 \\ncardiac events; only 2 patients (2%) developed a transient grade 3 left ventricular \\ndysfunction in the trastuzumab arm. In the GEPARQUATTRO trial, which was \\noriginally designed to test the efficacy of capecitabine in the neoadjuvant setting, \\ntrastuzumab was allowed as part of treatment in the HER-2-positive subgroup. The \\npCR rate, including residual ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS), was reported as 48.9% \\namong 340 HER-2-positive patients. In patients who were unresponsive to four \\ncycles of EC, the pCR rate in HER2-positive group was five times that in the HER2- \\nnegative cohort (16.7% vs 3.3%), again confirming the role of trastuzumab even in \\npatients with anthracycline-resistant disease [58].\\n Second-Generation Anti-Her-2 Agents and\\xa0Dual Blockade\\n Lapatinib\\nLapatinib, a dual EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor, has already been established as an \\nactive agent in the metastatic setting. In the GEPARQUINTO trial, lapatinib (L) was \\ntested head-to-head with trastuzumab (H) as part of a standard regimen consisting \\nof four cycles of EC followed by 4\\xa0cycles of docetaxel (T). Of 620 eligible patients, \\n30.3% in the ECH-TH group achieved pCR, a significant increase compared to the \\n252 Y. Eralp\\nECL-TL arm (22.7%) (p\\xa0 =\\xa0 0.04) [59]. The Neo-Altto trial evaluated the role of \\nlapatinib either as a single agent or in combination with trastuzumab compared to \\ntrastuzumab for 6\\xa0weeks followed by 12\\xa0weeks of weekly paclitaxel added to the \\nthree randomized arms before surgery. Despite an amendment for dose reduction in \\nthe lapatinib arms due to increased grade 3 and 4 diarrhea and hepatic toxicity, there \\nwas a higher pCR rate with dual blockade (51.3%) compared to-single agent trastu-\\nzumab (29.5%) or lapatinib (24.7%) (p\\xa0=\\xa00.0001) [60]. Nevertheless, a subsequent \\nstudy by the CALGB with a similar design that was reported recently showed no \\nadvantage of dual targeted therapy in terms of pCR (56% vs 46%) [61]. The NSABP \\nB41 trial, which differed slightly from the others in design, was a phase III trial that \\ninvestigated the role of dual blockade following four cycles of an anthracycline- \\nbased combination followed by surgery. In this trial, the pCR rate in the combina-\\ntion arm was 60%, which was marginally significant compared to the unexpectedly \\nhigh pCR rate for the trastuzumab and chemotherapy combination (52.5%; \\np\\xa0=\\xa00.056) [62]. Although the pCR rate in hormone receptor-negative patients was \\nnumerically higher than that in endocrine-responsive patients, the difference was \\nnot significant. The high rate of non-cardiac adverse effects favored trastuzumab as \\nthe single agent of choice. Given these data, there is as yet no evidence supporting \\nthe role of lapatinib as a single agent or in the context of dual Her-2 blockade.\\n Pertuzumab\\nPertuzumab is a monoclonal antibody that inhibits ligand-dependent signaling \\nbetween HER-2 and HER-3 receptors and thus has a complementary effect with \\ntrastuzumab. With encouraging data in metastatic patients as both a first-line and \\nsubsequent treatment option, pertuzumab was also evaluated in the neoadjuvant set-\\nting. Initially, feasibility and potential cardiotoxicity were evaluated in the phase II \\nTRYPHENA trial, which incorporated dual blockade with pertuzumab and trastu-\\nzumab in combination with a standard anthracycline-based and taxane-based regi-\\nmen, as well as a non-anthracycline-based TCH combination and FEC followed by \\ndocetaxel, trastuzumab and pertuzumab. This trial confirmed the cardiac safety of \\ndual blockade. In addition, the high pCR rate reaching 66% supported the efficacy \\nof non-anthracycline combinations in Her-2-positive disease [54].\\nIn the NEO-SPHERE trial, women with operable or locally advanced or inflam-\\nmatory breast cancer were randomized to receive four cycles every 3\\xa0 weeks of \\ndocetaxel, trastuzumab; or docetaxel, trastuzumab and pertuzumab; the doublet of \\nthe two monoclonal antibodies; or docetaxel and pertuzumab [63]. Following sur-\\ngery, patients in the docetaxel-containing arms received adjuvant FEC for three \\ncycles and trastuzumab every 3\\xa0weeks for 1\\xa0year. The remaining patients received \\nfour cycles of docetaxel followed by three cycles of FEC with trastuzumab in the \\nadjuvant setting. The in-breast pCR rate for pertuzumab added to the conventional \\ntrastuzumab and docetaxel combination was 46.8%, which was significantly higher \\nthan the pCR rates of 24% for the pertuzumab and docetaxel doublet and 29% for \\nthe trastuzumab and docetaxel combination. Furthermore, there was a small subset \\n9 Preoperative Systemic Therapy for\\xa0Operable Breast Cancer 253\\nof patients (16.8%) that achieved pCR with the double-antibody regimen, raising a \\nhypothetical question of whether there is really a group of patients who do not \\nrequire any chemotherapy at all [63]. There was some concern regarding toxicity \\nbecause the triplet combination resulted in more neutropenia and febrile neutrope-\\nnia, and there was one treatment-related death with fulminant hepatitis. Based on \\nthe significantly higher pCR rate for the combination, pertuzumab received FDA \\napproval in 2013 for the neoadjuvant treatment of Her-2-amplified breast cancer. An \\nupdated survival analysis showed numerically higher 5-year progression-free sur-\\nvival in the dual-blockade group compared with the standard arm of trastuzumab \\nand docetaxel (86 vs 81%). Although the confidence intervals are large and overlap-\\nping, these results suggest a higher efficacy of the pertuzumab, trastuzumab and \\nchemotherapy combination [64]. In light of accumulating data, further studies are \\nneeded to identify predictive markers that would help accurately define patients \\nwho would benefit from combined treatment strategies. Despite a lack of profound \\nsurvival benefit with dual blockade, it seems feasible to utilize pertuzumab and \\ntrastuzumab combination in the neoadjuvant setting, based on evidence showing \\nimproved outcomes with increased pCR rates.\\n TDM-1\\nTrastuzumab emtansine is a new-generation conjugated monoclonal antibody bound \\nwith a tubulin inhibitor (maytansine). Based on successful results in trastuzumab- \\nresistant disease as a second-line treatment in the advanced setting, TDM-1 was \\nsteadily incorporated in neoadjuvant trials. In the I-SPY trial, which followed an \\nadapted strategy, patients harboring one of the three predictive signatures were more \\nlikely to achieve pCR with the TDM-1 and pertuzumab combination than in the \\nstandard trastuzumab paclitaxel arm [65]. The KRISTINE trial was a phase III trial \\ncomparing 6\\xa0cycles of the TCHP regimen to a non-chemotherapy doublet of the \\nTDM-1 and pertuzumab combination. This trial yielded a lower pCR rate with the \\ninvestigational regimen compared to the platin-based combination (44 vs 56%) \\n[56], in line with the recently reported Marianne trial, which showed a lack of ben-\\nefit of the TDM-1 and pertuzumab regimen in the first-line advanced setting [66].\\nThe data on dual blockade in Her-2-positive disease are summarized in Table\\xa09.6.\\n Anti-Angiogenic Agents\\n Bevacizumab\\nBevacizumab, a monoclonal antibody targeting VEGF, has unfortunately been with-\\ndrawn by the FDA for indication as a treatment option for metastatic breast cancer \\npatients in light of recent data that failed to show a significant overall survival \\nadvantage despite favorable DFS rates.

This trial \\nfailed to show a benefit in terms of pCR of the addition of bevacizumab in the gen-\\neral population (17.5% vs 15%), with a subgroup benefit in the receptor-negative \\nsubset [69]. To evaluate the role of capecitabine and gemcitabine, a subsequent \\nstudy by the NSABP Group (NSABP B-40) randomized 1206 patients to docetaxel \\nfollowed by four cycles of AC and a second randomization with or without bevaci-\\nzumab. In this trial, the addition of bevacizumab significantly increased the pCR \\nrate, which was the primary endpoint, from 28.2% to 34.5% (p\\xa0=\\xa00.02), with greater \\nbenefit observed in the hormone receptor-positive subset [38]. Recently, an overall \\nsurvival advantage was also reported that was most evident in this subgroup [70]. \\nNevertheless, it is not clear if the benefit observed in this trial is due to a compensa-\\ntory effect in the context of a lower dose of docetaxel in the two thirds of patients \\nwho received the antibodies. In the CALGB 40603 trial, which included triple- \\nnegative patients, addition of bevacizumab resulted in an 8% incremental benefit \\nover the 44% pCR rate achieved with the platin-based combination (p\\xa0=\\xa00.057). \\nHowever, bevacizumab was associated with an increased incidence of grade 3 \\nhypertension, febrile neutropenia, bleeding and thromboembolic complications \\n[47]. In the updated survival analysis, use of bevacizumab failed to result in a sig-\\nnificant improvement in EFS or OS [49]. In conclusion, considering the conflicting \\nevidence regarding the efficacy of bevacizumab within distinct molecular subgroups \\nand the lack of a valid predictive marker, bevacizumab cannot be considered stan-\\ndard in the neoadjuvant setting at this time.\\n256 Y. Eralp\\n M-TOR Inhibitors\\n Everolimus\\nMammalian target of rapamycin (m-TOR) is a valid target that is frequently dis-\\nrupted in breast cancer pathogenesis. The accumulation of favorable data in combi-\\nnation with hormonal and cytotoxic agents led to the randomized GEPARQUINTO \\ntrial, which evaluated the role of everolimus in combination with paclitaxel as a \\nsecond randomization in patients who were resistant to neoadjuvant EC with or \\nwithout bevacizumab. The trial was stopped prematurely after 395 patients were \\nrandomized due to completion of the main trial. In terms of pCR, there was no dif-\\nference between study arms (3.6% vs 5.6%). Almost half of the patient group had to \\nstop treatment due to side effects in the combination arm, and there were concerns \\nabout whether everolimus attenuated the cytotoxic effects of paclitaxel with inhibi-\\ntion of cell cycle progression. In addition, there was no indication of any subgroup \\nthat might benefit from the addition of everolimus to paclitaxel in this resistant \\ngroup of patients [71].\\n Conclusion\\nNeoadjuvant chemotherapy offers an ideal setting to identify regimens or agents \\nthat could be prioritized for adjuvant confirmatory trials and to identify biomark-\\ners or genomic signatures that would predict response or resistance to a given \\nregimen. Numerous trials performed over the last three or four decades have \\nprovided valuable information on the biology of breast cancer, as well as efficacy \\ndata that helped to improve treatment strategies in earlier stages. There exists \\nsubstantial evidence from meta-analyses suggesting that pCR is an important \\nsurrogate endpoint for outcome in most subgroups, and it is now argued that \\ncostly, time-consuming large trials may be spared for agents showing a high pCR \\nrate with survival advantage in the neoadjuvant setting. With the advent of \\nmolecular diagnostic techniques and translational medicine, the last decade has \\nproved to be an exciting era for oncology research. Nevertheless, the more we \\nexamine the basic mechanisms of oncogenesis, the deeper in the abyss of the \\ncancer enigma we find ourselves. There appears to be much more to be accom-\\nplished than ever to develop better treatment options for patients with breast \\ncancer.\\nIn conclusion, preoperative systemic chemotherapy is a valuable research tool \\nfor identifying predictive molecular biomarkers and a valid treatment option for \\npatients with early-stage breast cancer. However, the decision to treat a patient with \\nneoadjuvant chemotherapy requires careful clinical judgment and multidisciplinary \\nevaluation by an experienced team.\\n9 Preoperative Systemic Therapy for\\xa0Operable Breast Cancer 257\\nReferences\\n 1.

Neoadjuvant therapy should \\nbe considered for women with large clinical stage IIA, stage IIB, and T3N1M0 \\ntumors who meet the criteria for breast-conserving therapy except tumor size and \\nwish to undergo breast-conserving therapy and for patients with locally advanced \\nbreast cancer (LABC). LABC has always included a heterogeneous group of pre-\\nsentations. According to the American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) staging \\nsystem, LABC technically can include a patient with a clinically apparent internal \\nmammary or paraclavicular node as well as the more commonly accepted presenta-\\ntions, which include a primary breast cancer larger than 5\\xa0cm, disease fixed to the \\nchest wall or involving the skin, or bulky palpable disease in the axilla. Inflammatory \\nbreast cancer can also be called LABC.\\nThe primary objective of neoadjuvant therapy is to improve the surgical out-\\ncomes in patients for whom a primary surgical approach is technically not feasible \\nand in patients with operable breast cancer who desire breast conservation but for \\nwhom either a mastectomy is required or a partial mastectomy would result in a \\npoor cosmetic outcome [1–3] (Figs.\\xa010.1, 10.2, 10.3, 10.4, and 10.5). Although it \\nwas hypothesized that overall survival would improve with earlier initiation of sys-\\ntemic therapy in patients at risk of distant recurrence, clinical studies have not yet \\ndemonstrated a mortality benefit for pre-versus postoperative delivery of systemic \\nS.

The St Gallen 2017 Consensus Panel supported dual anti- \\nHER2 therapy as an acceptable regimen with neoadjuvant taxane, trastuzumab and pertuzumab in \\nsuch patients and considered anthracycline-taxane and anti-HER2 treatments as the best options. \\nbStage II–III triple-negative disease: If provided to patients with triple-negative tumors, the pre-\\nferred regimen should include an anthracycline and a taxane. Although the available data are insuf-\\nficient, a platinum-based regimen may be considered only in patients with a known BRCA \\nmutation. Anthracyclines followed by taxanes is an acceptable regimen for BRCA-mutant \\nTNBC.\\xa0Dose-dense chemotherapy requiring growth factor support may also be an option. cNeoad-\\njuvant cytotoxic therapy should be discussed as an option and provided frequently to patients with \\n“Luminal A-like” tumors, only if conservative surgery would not otherwise be feasible. \\nNeoadjuvant chemotherapy should be administered to T2 and T3 tumors (N0-N1) meeting BCS \\ncriteria except tumor diameter, or to triple negative and HER-2-positive patients. dNeoadjuvant \\nendocrine therapy without cytotoxics represents a reasonable option for some selected postmeno-\\npausal patients with endocrine-responsive disease. The duration of treatment must be at least \\n4–6\\xa0months, and treatment can be provided until a maximal response is reached\\ntherapy.

If SLN is positive, axillary lymph node dissection must be \\nperformed. After downstaging, resection of the entire area of the original primary tumor is not neces-\\nsary (if there is shrinkage in the tumor). MR imaging is recommended in patients who will undergo \\nBCS after neoadjuvant therapy. Clinical examination and radiological imaging modalities (USG, \\nMMG, MR imaging) are used to evaluate the tissue to be excised (shrinking or patching). However, if \\nthe tumor response is patchy, the original tumor area should be removed with clean surgical margins. \\nIf diffuse live tumor cells are observed in the excised lumpectomy specimen after neoadjuvant chemo-\\ntherapy, re-excision should be performed, even if there is no surgical margin involvement. bConsider \\nadjuvant bisphosphonate therapy in postmenopausal (natural or induced) patients receiving adjuvant \\ntherapy. cAdditional adjuvant systemic chemotherapy may be given to patients who are considered to \\nhave an inadequate response according to postoperative pathology (adjuvant chemotherapy may be \\ngiven if the pathological response to neoadjuvant taxane-anthracycline is inadequate in triple-negative \\ntumors).

According to the results of a \\nrandomized study, 1-year administration of trastuzumab after neratinib use for 1\\xa0year reduced the \\nrecurrence rate. This benefit was obvious especially in ER-positive, HER-2-positive disease. \\nHowever, diarrhea is an important side effect. The rate of pCR is lower when neoadjuvant ado- \\ntrastuzumab emtansine (TDM-1) is given with pertuzumab than for chemotherapy-trastuzumab- \\npertuzumab (TCHP) treatment. bFor triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC), the regimen should \\ncontain anthracyclines and taxanes. The addition of carboplatin to the treatment increases the rate \\nof pathologic complete response (pCR), which prolongs disease-free survival. Although the avail-\\nable data are insufficient, a platinum-based regimen may be considered only in patients with a \\nknown BRCA mutation. Anthracyclines followed by taxanes is an acceptable regimen for BRCA- \\nmutant TNBC.\\xa0 In an adaptive study, the addition of veliparib and carboplatin to the treatment \\nincreased the rate of pCR.\\xa0Dose-dense chemotherapy requiring growth factor support may also be \\nan option. cData regarding the use of nab-paclitaxel instead of paclitaxel in neoadjuvant chemo-\\ntherapy are inconsistent.dNeoadjuvant endocrine therapy shows a high response rates in patients \\nwith low genomic scores. eConsider adjuvant bisphosphonate therapy in postmenopausal (natural \\nor induced) patients receiving adjuvant therapy\\n10 Preoperative Systemic Therapy for\\xa0Non-Inflammatory Locally Advanced Breast Cancer 269\\n Treatment Options\\nThe options for neoadjuvant treatment include chemotherapy, endocrine therapy, \\nand the incorporation of biological therapy in appropriate patients. Much of the \\ninformation regarding neoadjuvant therapy comes from trials utilizing chemother-\\napy, with recent studies assessing the role of biologics.\\nFor women with HER2-negative, estrogen-receptor (ER)- and/or progesterone- \\nreceptor (PR)-positive breast cancers who are not candidates for initial resection, \\nwe suggest neoadjuvant chemotherapy rather than endocrine therapy [8, 9]. While \\nfew of these patients will achieve a clinical or pathologic complete response, tumor \\nshrinkage may enable surgery for some unresectable patients and breast conserva-\\ntion for some borderline patients. Neoadjuvant therapy is typically indicated in \\nwomen with larger tumors and/or locally advanced breast cancer. In such situations, \\nmost premenopausal women should receive chemotherapy rather than endocrine \\ntherapy. If a premenopausal woman refuses (or is not a good candidate for) neoad-\\njuvant chemotherapy, we suggest proceeding to surgical treatment, if possible, \\nrather than attempting neoadjuvant endocrine therapy.\\nMost postmenopausal women for whom neoadjuvant treatment is indicated \\nreceive chemotherapy, although endocrine therapy may be offered as an alternative \\nfor some women. While historically neoadjuvant endocrine therapy (NET) has been \\nreserved for patients with substantial comorbid health problems who would not \\ntolerate chemotherapy, it is increasingly seen as a viable alternative for other \\npatients, especially those with human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-\\nnegative, HR-positive tumors that are strongly ER positive. In such patients, NET \\nmay enable improved surgical outcomes and cosmesis.\\nThe response to endocrine therapy has been shown to correlate with levels of ER \\nexpression, as quantified by the Allred score. In a study of 324 postmenopausal \\nwomen with HR-positive breast cancer randomly assigned to 4\\xa0months of tamoxifen \\nor letrozole, response rates among those with Allred scores of 7–8 were >60% for \\nletrozole and approximately 30–45% for tamoxifen, whereas the response rate for \\npatients with Allred scores of 0–2 was 0% [10].\\nSeveral trials have also investigated the role of endocrine therapy in combination \\nwith other targeted therapies. These include combinations of endocrine therapy with \\neverolimus, celecoxib, zoledronic acid, gefitinib, lapatinib, and palbociclib. \\nAlthough general combination therapy is associated with a higher response rate, \\ngiven the lack of survival data and concern about added toxicity, combination ther-\\napy cannot be recommended for routine clinical practice. Several ongoing trials are \\ninvestigating the role of combination therapy, including the combination of aroma-\\ntase inhibitors with cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) 4/6 inhibitors (NeoMONARCH), \\nPI3K inhibitors (LORELEI), and dual endocrine therapy (ALTERNATE).\\nFor patients with HER2-positive breast cancer who are not candidates for surgery or \\nwho have larger tumors (T2-T3) and desire breast-conserving surgery, we recommend \\nthe addition of anti-HER2 therapy to neoadjuvant therapy over chemotherapy alone.\\nSeveral chemotherapy regimens have been studied as preoperative systemic \\ntherapy. The regimens recommended in the adjuvant setting are appropriate for \\n270 S. Keskin and A. Aydiner\\nconsideration in the preoperative systemic therapy setting [11, 12]. The outcomes \\nof neoadjuvant therapy were demonstrated in a 2007 meta-analysis that included \\ndata for 5500 women participating in 1 of 14 trials reported between 1991 and \\n2001 [13]. Compared to adjuvant chemotherapy, neoadjuvant therapy resulted in \\nequivalent overall survival (hazard ratio [HR] 0.98, 95% CI 0.87–1.09) and dis-\\nease-free survival (HR 0.97, 95% CI 0.89–1.07) and a reduction in the likelihood \\nof modified radical mastectomy (HR 0.71, 95% CI 0.67–0.75).\\nThe choice of specific chemotherapy drugs and regimens should be based on \\ntumor biology and intrinsic subsets (i.e., triple negative, estrogen receptor positive, \\nHER2 positive) [12–14]. There is no reason to assume that regimens administered \\nin the adjuvant setting would be less active when used prior to surgery. Because a \\nreduction in tumor size to permit surgery is the primary objective of neoadjuvant \\ntherapy, all planned treatment should be administered prior to definitive surgery, \\nprovided there is no evidence of disease progression during treatment.\\nMultiple studies have demonstrated that anthracycline-based regimens incorpo-\\nrating a taxane (either concurrently or in sequence with anthracycline-based regi-\\nmens) are associated with increased response rates in the neoadjuvant setting \\ncompared to the use of non-taxane-containing regimens [15]. Ongoing clinical \\nresearch is examining whether the addition of non-cross-resistant agents with dem-\\nonstrated activity in metastatic breast cancer might improve the clinical and patho-\\nlogic response rates observed with the use of an anthracycline and/or a taxane. \\nHowever, there is no evidence that this approach improves survival outcomes or \\nresponse rates. Thus, we suggest not administering additional agents with standard \\nanthracycline- and taxane-based neoadjuvant therapy (Table\\xa010.1). \\nTable 10.1 Neoadjuvant therapy in HER2-negative breast cancer\\npCR definition applied \\nExperimental Control No. of to breast (B) or breast pCR, \\nStudy regimen regimen patients and lymph nodes (B/LN) % p\\nAnthracycline and taxane-based vs anthracycline-based regimens\\nDiéras AP AC 200 B/LN 8 vs 6 NS\\net\\xa0al.

However, until \\nmore data are available, we recommend chemotherapy for most patients in the \\n neoadjuvant setting.\\n HER2-Directed Therapy\\nThe benefit of adding trastuzumab to chemotherapy was demonstrated in a pooled \\nanalysis of two randomized studies that evaluated neoadjuvant therapy with or with-\\nout trastuzumab [22]. The addition of trastuzumab to chemotherapy resulted in an \\nimprovement in the rate of pCR (43% versus 20%; relative risk for achieving pCR \\n[RR] 2.07, 95% CI 1.41–3.03); a reduction in the relapse rate (26% versus 39%; RR \\nfor relapse 0.67, 95% CI 0.48–0.94); and a trend toward a lower mortality rate (13% \\nversus 20%; RR for mortality 0.67, 95% CI 0.39–1.15) that did not reach statistical \\nsignificance.\\nPertuzumab is a recombinant humanized monoclonal antibody that inhibits the \\nligand-dependent dimerization of HER2 and its downstream signaling. Pertuzumab \\nand trastuzumab bind to different epitopes of the HER2 receptor and have comple-\\nmentary mechanisms of action. When administered together in HER2-positive \\ntumor models and in humans, pertuzumab and trastuzumab provide a greater over-\\nall anti-tumor effect than either alone. Because the combination of pertuzumab and \\ntrastuzumab exhibited a significant overall survival benefit in a metastatic setting, \\nit has also been examined in the neoadjuvant setting [23]. The combination of \\ntrastuzumab plus pertuzumab was evaluated in the neoadjuvant setting with \\nresponses noted even without the use of chemotherapy. These results are fascinat-\\ning not only because of the higher pCR rate associated with chemotherapy plus \\ntrastuzumab and pertuzumab but also because of the frequency of pCR associated \\nwith dual HER2- targeted therapy alone, particularly in patients with ER-negative \\ndisease [23–29] (Table\\xa010.2). \\n Treatment Evaluation\\nPatients receiving neoadjuvant systemic therapy should be followed by clinical \\nexam at regular intervals during treatment to ensure that the disease is not progress-\\ning. At the end of treatment, an assessment of tumor response is important to help \\nguide the surgical approach.\\nThere are no formal guidelines regarding the ideal assessment strategy during \\nneoadjuvant treatment. Our approach is as follows:\\n• For patients on neoadjuvant therapy, we perform a clinical examination every \\n2–4\\xa0weeks (i.e., prior to each cycle of treatment). This should include evaluation \\nof the affected breast and ipsilateral axilla.\\n272 S. Keskin and A.

Clinical response is not an accurate predictor of \\npathological response, and achieving a pCR in the breast and axilla is a better pre-\\ndictor of survival than a clinical complete response is.\\nThe prognostic significance of pCR for survival endpoints has been evaluated in \\nseveral meta-analyses [30, 31]. The largest of these was conducted by the Collaborative \\n10 Preoperative Systemic Therapy for\\xa0Non-Inflammatory Locally Advanced Breast Cancer 273\\nTrials in Neoadjuvant Breast Cancer (CTNeoBC) working group and included 12 ran-\\ndomized trials and nearly 12,000 patients [30]. Their major findings were as follows. \\nPatients who achieved pCR had significant improvements in event-f ree survival (hazard \\nratio [HR] 0.48, p\\xa0<\\xa00.001) and overall survival ([OS] HR 0.36, p\\xa0<\\xa00.001) compared to \\npatients who did not achieve pCR.\\xa0The inclusion of patients with residual ductal carci-\\nnoma in situ (DCIS) only (ypT0/is, ypN0) did not diminish the benefit of achieving pCR \\nfor event-free survival and overall survival. However, the inclusion of patients with \\nresidual axillary nodal involvement in the definition of pCR reduced its prognostic value \\nfor both event-free survival and overall survival. pCR rates and improvement in event-\\nfree survival for patients who achieved pCR varied by breast cancer subtype:\\n• Hormone receptor (HR)-positive, HER2-negative, grade 1 to 2: 8% (HR for \\nevent-free survival 0.63, p\\xa0=\\xa00.07)\\n• HR-positive, HER2-negative, grade 3: 16% (HR 0.27, p\\xa0<\\xa00.001)\\n• HR-positive, HER2-positive (treated with a trastuzumab-containing regimen): \\n31% (HR 0.58, p\\xa0=\\xa00.001)\\n• HR-negative, HER2-negative (triple-negative): 34% (HR 0.24, p\\xa0<\\xa00.001)\\n• HR-negative, HER2-positive (treated with a trastuzumab-containing regimen): \\n50% (HR 0.25, p\\xa0<\\xa00.001)\\nDespite these results, the threshold of benefit (defined by an increase in the pCR \\nrate) associated with an improvement in event-free survival and/or overall survival \\nis not clear. The investigators hypothesized that the lack of an association may have \\nbeen due to the heterogeneous patient populations in many of the studies, the rela-\\ntively low pCR rates (even in the “superior” treatment arm), and/or the lack of effec-\\ntive targeted agents for many of the patient populations studied.\\n Conclusion\\nIn conclusion, preoperative systemic chemotherapy is a valuable research tool to \\nidentify predictive molecular biomarkers and a valid treatment option for patients \\nwith early-stage or locally advanced breast cancer. However, the decision regarding \\nneoadjuvant treatment should be made after discussion of the patient’s clinical, his-\\ntological, and imaging characteristics by a multidisciplinary oncology board.\\nReferences\\n 1. van der Hage JA, van de Velde CJ, Julien JP, Tubiana-Hulin M, Vandervelden C, Duchateau \\nL.\\xa0 Preoperative chemotherapy in primary operable breast cancer: results from the \\nEuropean Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer trial 10902.

IBC is characterized by skin changes \\nthat are suggestive of infection and inflammation, usually with fairly abrupt onset \\nand rapid progression. The duration of symptoms before diagnosis is usually less \\nthan 3\\xa0months [1–5]. The most common symptoms are a feeling of warmth and \\nheaviness, itching, nipple retraction, and pain in the affected breast. IBC is fre-\\nquently misdiagnosed as cellulitis or acute mastitis. Acute-phase radiation dermati-\\ntis, sarcoma or lymphoma of the breast, inflammatory metastatic melanoma, and \\nPaget’s disease of the nipple can also mimic IBC.\\nThe minimum diagnostic criteria for the diagnosis of IBC are the following [6–8]:\\n• Rapid onset of breast erythema (with a palpable border), edema and/or dermal \\nedema (peau d’orange), and/or warm breast, with or without an underlying pal-\\npable mass;\\n• A duration of symptom history of no more than 6\\xa0months;\\n• Erythema occupying at least one third of the breast;\\n• Pathological confirmation of invasive carcinoma.\\nPrimary IBC is classified as T4d according to the American Joint Commission \\nfor Cancer (AJCC) staging system and is staged as IIIB, IIIC, or IV according to \\nnodal involvement and distant metastases [7, 8]. IBC is not an entity of locally \\nadvanced breast carcinoma (LABC) but is completely separate according to epide-\\nmiological and molecular evidence. The outcomes of these two diseases are quite \\nN.

In addition, a distinction must be made between primary and secondary \\nIBC [2]. In primary IBC, skin alterations and carcinoma develop concurrently from \\nthe previously healthy breast, whereas in secondary IBC, inflammatory skin altera-\\ntions appear subsequent to malignancy development [1, 2, 4, 5] (Fig.\\xa011.1).\\n Epidemiology, Etiology, and\\xa0Risk Factors\\nThe reported incidence of IBC varies due to a lack of consensus regarding the case \\ndefinition for the disease [9]. In the United States, the incidence of IBC ranges from \\n1% to 6% [10–12]. Data from the SEER program have demonstrated that the age- \\nadjusted incidence rates for IBC increased significantly between 1988–1990 and \\n1997–1999 (from 2.0 to 2.5 cases/100,000 woman-years; P\\xa0<\\xa00.001) [13]. The inci-\\ndence of IBC is significantly higher in African-American women than in Caucasian \\nwomen (3.1/100,000 woman-years vs. 2.2/100,000 woman-years, respectively) \\n11 Inflammatory Breast Cancer 279\\n[13]. The incidence is lowest among Asian Pacific Islander women (0.7 cases/100,000 \\nwoman-years) [14]. In Morocco, Egypt, Algeria, and Tunisia, the reported inci-\\ndence rates are very high, and nearly 10–15% of all breast cancers are stated to \\npresent as IBC [15–18].\\nIBC generally has an early onset. The maximal peak age at diagnosis is approxi-\\nmately 50\\xa0years. According to the SEER database, the median age at diagnosis is \\nlower in patients with IBC (58.8\\xa0years) than in patients with non-T4 breast cancer \\n(61.7\\xa0years, P\\xa0<\\xa00.0001) and LABC (66.2\\xa0years, P\\xa0<\\xa00.0001) [13]. In addition, race \\nseems to be an important risk factor, as African-American women are at a higher \\nrisk of developing the disease. The age of onset also varies according to race and \\nethnicity [14]. Compared to Caucasians, African-Americans present at a younger \\nage of onset (median age 55.2 versus 58.1\\xa0 years) with an inferior prognosis. \\nHowever, Hispanic women present with the youngest average age (median \\n50.5\\xa0years) at the initial diagnosis of IBC.\\nPossible risk factors for IBC are young age at first birth (<20\\xa0years), pregnancy \\n(21–26% of IBC cases develop during or after pregnancy), lactation (longer cumu-\\nlative duration of breastfeeding history), increased BMI (>26.65; the odds ratio for \\nIBC vs. other types of BC is 2.45), blood group A, and rural residency [1–4, 12, \\n19–22]. However, it should be recognized that these risk factors are currently based \\non smaller studies and have not been well-established.\\nImmunological factors have been examined in Tunisian studies. Immunodeficiency \\nwas not observed, but the results suggested that a hyperimmune response may be \\nthe cause of this rapidly progressing breast cancer [23, 24].\\nBecause of the rapid onset and clinical characteristics of IBC, the involvement \\nof viral infection was suggested by Pogo et\\xa0al. [25]. They detected human mam-\\nmary tumor virus (HMTV), a provirus structure with 96% homology with mouse \\nmammary tumor virus (MMTV), in 71% of IBC cases compared to 40% of non-IBC \\ncases in American patients [25]. HMTV-positive IBC was significantly higher in \\nbreast cancer patients in Tunisia (74%) compared with those in the United States \\n(36%), Italy (38%), Argentina (31%), and Vietnam (0.8%) [26]. Another study \\nfrom Egypt demonstrated that human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) infection enhances \\nthe expression and activation of transcription factor NF-kB (nuclear factor-kB/\\np65′, which controls different cytokines) signaling in IBC patients [27]. HCMV \\ninfection may be associated with the etiology and progression of IBC versus non-\\nIBC. The relationship between viral etiology and IBC is under investigation in the \\nUnited States [2].\\nAlthough the median age of IBC is younger than that of non-IBC, BRCA1, BRCA2, \\nand PTEN do not play a strong role in IBC. BRCA testing is not routinely recom-\\nmended, except in cases with a strong family history [8]. In one retrospective study, \\nthere was no statistically significant difference (P\\xa0=\\xa00.169) in the rate of BRCA1 and \\nBRCA2 mutations between IBC (35.9%; total 39 patients) and non-IBC (26.1%; total \\n992 patients) [28]. In another study, the percentage of patients with a positive family \\nhistory was 13% in IBC cases and 8% in non-IBC [19]. This difference was not sta-\\ntistically significant. Family history was significantly more  common in IBC cases \\nthan in non-IBC cases (20% versus 5%, respectively) in one Pakistani study [29].\\n280 N. Guler\\n Imaging Studies\\nMammography is the least sensitive and least effective method for the diagnosis of \\nIBC and detects only 43% of breast parenchymal lesions [30]. Therefore, IBC is \\nusually not detected by mammographic scanning. The most common signs of IBC \\nby mammography are skin thickening and trabecular distortion; a mass is often vis-\\nible by ultrasonography (USG) [5, 6, 31]. Both the mammary tissue and local lymph \\nnodes should be evaluated by USG. Axillary lymph node metastases are detected in \\n90% of all patients. Parenchymal lesions in the breasts can be identified in nearly \\n95% of IBC patients by USG, which is also a useful method for obtaining biopsies \\nfrom lesions. Recently, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has become a popular \\nmethod for visualizing the breast. The reported success rates of MRI, USG, and \\nmammography in detecting parenchymal lesions in patients with proven IBC are \\n100%, 95% and 80%, respectively [31]. Although MRI appears to be the best \\nmethod, it is not recommended for routine diagnostic imaging and is advised only \\nunder two conditions [6]: when parenchymal lesions cannot be detected with mam-\\nmography or USG and when patients are recruited for research studies that evaluate \\nthe use of MRI of the breast in the diagnosis of IBC.\\nLocal-regional disease is present in all patients diagnosed with IBC; however, \\napproximately 30% of patients have metastatic disease at the time of diagnosis. \\nTherefore, a systemic staging workup [e.g., computed tomography, bone scintigra-\\nphy, 8F FDG PET/CT (fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography/com-\\nputed tomography)] should be performed in every patient [1–5, 6, 8]. In addition, \\ncross-sectional imaging of the neck and an evaluation of infra- and supraclavicular \\nlymph nodes during radiological imaging and planning of radiotherapy are equally \\nimportant [6].\\n Tissue Sampling and\\xa0Pathology\\nPreoperative systemic chemotherapy (PSC) is the standard therapy for IBC treatment \\n[1–5]. Sufficient tissue sampling from the parenchymal lesion in the affected breast \\nduring the pretreatment period is essential for both future treatment planning and \\nsubsequent research studies [1–4, 6]. The presence of an invasive cancer, the identi-\\nfication of the histological type and grade of the tumor, and the expression of the ER, \\nprogesterone receptor (PR), and HER2 should be clarified with utmost care. If there \\nis doubt about metastasis in the axillary and/or supraclavicular lymph nodes, image-\\nguided core biopsies and analysis of prognostic and predictive markers are suggested \\n[6]. For patients who meet the diagnostic criteria for IBC, obtaining at least two skin \\npunch biopsies to determine dermal lymphatic invasion (DLI) is recommended. \\nApart from their significance in indicating the presence of DLI, these biopsies are \\nalso important for the diagnosis of invasive cancer in patients with no detectable \\nintraparenchymal breast lesions or regional metastases. The best site for sampling is \\nbelieved to be the region with the most significant color alteration on the breast skin \\n11 Inflammatory Breast Cancer 281\\n[6]. A 2- to 8-mm biopsy specimen taken from that region is sufficient to demonstrate \\nthe presence of DLI.\\xa0However, although DLI is responsible for the clinically observed \\ninflammatory alterations in IBC, it is not necessary for diagnosis [6, 8, 32].\\nAll pathological subtypes of invasive adenocarcinoma can be associated with \\nIBC [4, 32, 33]. IBC is also rarely seen in male patients [34]. IBC is often in the \\nform of ductal carcinoma. It is a highly angiogenic and invasive type of cancer that \\nis characterized by a high histological grade and HER2 positivity with a high rate of \\nER negativity. p53 mutations are common (70% in IBC and 48% in non-IBC, \\nP\\xa0=\\xa00.0238) [29].\\nThere are three subtypes of IBC: clinicopathologically apparent IBC, clinically \\napparent IBC, and pathological (occult) IBC [2]. Two population-based studies used \\nthis classification for IBC to demonstrate that patients with occult IBC have better \\ndisease-free survival (DFS) (5-year DFS 51.6% vs. 25.6%, respectively) and OS than \\npatients with clinically apparent IBC (5-year OS 40% vs. 28.6%, respectively) [35, 36].\\nThe molecular subtypes of IBC are the same as those of non-IBC (luminal, triple \\nnegative, and HER2 positive). Twenty to forty percent of all IBC cases are triple nega-\\ntive (TN), whereas 15–20% of non-IBC cases display this molecular subtype [37].\\n Preoperative Systemic Therapy\\nHistorically, radical mastectomy was the primary modality for treating IBC. Surgery \\nalone resulted in a very poor prognosis and a 5-year survival of less than 5%, with a \\nmedian survival of 12–32\\xa0months [38, 39]. Over the past 30\\xa0years, the treatment of \\nIBC has significantly evolved. Because of the systemic nature of the disease, adding \\nradiotherapy (RT) after surgery increased only locoregional control without increas-\\ning OS [40–42]. The addition of preoperative systemic chemotherapy (PSC) (also \\nreferred to as neoadjuvant, preoperative, or induction) before surgery and RT has \\nbeen associated with significantly increased survival rates of 30–50% for 5-year \\nsurvival and 24% for 15-year survival [43–48].\\nBreast-conserving surgery is not suggested for IBC because it is a disease that \\noften has a diffuse character [1–4]. Mastectomy and axillary lymph node dissection \\nare the optimal surgical procedure. A clinical response evaluation by physical exami-\\nnation and imaging techniques may underestimate the extent of residual disease [1–5, \\n8, 46, 47]. The removal of all gross disease is important because skin lymphatic \\ninvolvement may extend beyond the area of visible skin changes. After  mastectomy, \\npostmastectomy RT to the chest wall and axillary, infraclavicular, and supraclavicular, \\nand internal mammary lymph nodes (if involved; consider internal mammary nodes if \\nnot clinically involved) is part of standard multimodality treatment [1–4, 8, 48].\\nHistorically, primary systemic treatment included only chemotherapy (CT). \\nHowever, in recent years, some targeted therapies have been used together with CT \\nbased on tumor characteristics. Survival was analyzed in IBC cases who were \\ntreated before and after October 2006 at MD Anderson Cancer Center (MDACC) \\n[49]. The date October 2006 was chosen because this date was the beginning of anti- \\nHER2 usage in standard neoadjuvant chemotherapies (NACT) and the opening of a \\n282 N. Guler\\nmultidisciplinary IBC clinic. Before this date, 3-year OS was 63%; after this date, \\nthe rate increased to 82% (P\\xa0=\\xa00.02). Multivariate analysis demonstrated that anti- \\nHER2 therapies (HR\\xa0 =\\xa0 0.38; 95% CI 0.17–0.84; P\\xa0 =\\xa0 0.02) and ER positivity \\n(HR\\xa0=\\xa00.032; CI 0.14–0.74, P\\xa0=\\xa00.01) are important factors for survival.\\nRandomized clinical trials assessing therapy have not been performed because of \\nthe rare occurrence of the disease. Many of the cases are evaluated in protocols in \\nthe same way as the LABC study. Data are gathered from one-armed studies and \\nretrospective case series [43–48].\\nTreatment should begin with NACT.\\xa0There is no standard primary CT regimen or \\ncombination. However, anthracyclines and taxanes are constant members of current \\nprimary chemotherapy regimens. The optimal sequence, dose, duration, and inten-\\nsity of the CT regimen remain to be defined, and the optimal sequence and type of \\nlocoregional therapy have not yet been resolved.\\n Preoperative Systemic Chemotherapy\\nIn pre-1970 clinical trials, IBC cases were excluded because of their rarity and poor \\noverall prognosis. Most IBC cases were treated with the same regimens used for the \\ntreatment of non-IBC cases. In recent years, CT trials specifically designed for \\npatients with IBC have increased. The response to PSC has prognostic significance. \\nPatients with pCR (complete clearance of the tumor in the breast and axilla) have a \\nsignificantly increased DFS rate. Here, I would like to discuss PSC chronologically.\\nMDACC is the most experienced center for IBC. Since 1974, MDACC has been \\nplanning prospective studies on only IBC patients. As of 2010, 242 IBC patients had \\nbeen enrolled in clinical trials. These studies demonstrated that PSC is necessary for \\nthis group of patients. The response to NACT is a surrogate marker for long-term \\nsurvival. The survival of patients without a response to NACT is shorter than those \\nwith a response. In one study, NACT was applied to 175 IBC patients [50]. After \\nNACT and surgery, 61 of the 175 patients had residual disease in the breast and axil-\\nlary lymph nodes. The 5-year relapse-free survival (RFS) was 82.5% and the OS \\nwas 78.6% in patients with pCR after NACT, but in the group with residual disease \\nafter NACT, RFS was 37.1%, and OS was 25.4%.\\nFirst CMF (cyclophosphamide, methotrexate, 5-fluorouracil) and similar regi-\\nmens, then anthracycline-containing CT regimens, and finally taxanes have been \\nused for NACT in IBC (Fig.\\xa011.2). \\n Anthracyclines\\nActive chemotherapy applications for IBC began in 1970. Anthracycline-containing \\nNACT studies involving 15–192 patients have reported improvements in response \\nrates from 20% to 93% and in complete response (CR) rates from 4% to 55% [41]. \\npCR ratios improved from 3% to 16% [45].\\n11 Inflammatory Breast Cancer 283\\nChemotherapy \\n(Anthracycline + taxane: preferred)\\nIf tumor is HER2 positive, trastuzumab-containing regimen (ex. \\nTrastuzumab plus pertuzumab plus chemotherapy, but not \\nsimultaneously with anthracycline)(a-c)\\nRESPONSIVE UNRESPONSIVE\\nTotal mastectomy + level I/II Supplemental systemic \\naxillary dissection + RT to chest chemotherapy and/or \\nwall and lymphatic areas ± late preoperative RT\\nbreast reconstruction\\nIf not completed RESPONSIVE UNRESPONSIVE\\npreoperatively, complete \\nplanned chemotherapy \\nregimen plus endocrine PERSONALIZED \\ntherapy following SEE ABOVE THERAPY\\nsequential chemotherapy \\nif HR-positive (proposal 1)\\nIf HER2 positive, complete anti-HER2 \\ntherapy (proposal 1)\\nFor patients with triple-negative tumors, evaluate for additional \\nchemotherapy (if standard chemotherapy completed preoperatively)\\nFig. 11.2 Locoregional and systemic treatment of inflammatory breast cancer. aHER2-targeted \\ntherapy: Trastuzumab + pertuzumab + chemotherapy should be administered to HER2-positive \\npatients in neoadjuvant therapy.

Paclitaxel (P) \\nwas added to the therapy regimen of patients with stable disease or who had a minor \\nresponse to NACT during the preoperative period, and P was added as an adjuvant \\ntherapy in all patients. NACT and then surgery, followed by adjuvant chemotherapy \\nand then radiotherapy, were applied. The objective/clinical response rate was 77% \\n(vs. 72% in regimens containing only anthracycline), and the median survival time \\nwas 46\\xa0 months (vs. 37\\xa0 months in regimens containing only anthracycline). The \\nresults were not statistically significant.\\nIn another study, anthracycline-based and taxane-based NACT protocols were \\ncompared in patients with IBC. Group 1 included 178 patients who received \\nanthracycline- containing induction chemotherapy, and group 2 included 62 patients \\n286 N. Guler\\nTable 11.2 MDACC comparison of neoadjuvant-only anthracycline and anthracycline-taxane- \\ncontaining chemotherapy protocols in patients with inflammatory breast cancer [53, 55]\\nParameter Group 1 Group 2\\nn 178 patients 62 patients\\nFollow-up years 1973–1993 1994–2000\\nMedian follow-up (months) 148 (85–283) 45 (21–99)\\nChemotherapy protocol FAC-based regimens FAC followed by 3 weekly P  \\nor weekly high-dose P\\nORR 72% 79%\\n3-year PFS 39% 46% p\\xa0=\\xa00.19\\n3-year OS 53% 71% p\\xa0=\\xa00.12\\npCR rate 10% 25%\\nER-negative tumors 33% 65%\\nMedian PFS (ER-negative group) 18\\xa0months 27\\xa0months p\\xa0=\\xa00.042\\nMedian OS (ER-negative group) 32\\xa0months 54\\xa0months p\\xa0=\\xa00.035\\n3-year PFS (ER-negative group) 31% 39%\\n3-year OS (ER-negative group) 43% 71%\\nwho received taxane-containing chemotherapy (Tables 11.1 and 11.2) [54, 55]. The \\nmedian follow-up period was 148\\xa0months (range: 85–283\\xa0months) for group 1 and \\n45\\xa0months (range: 21–99\\xa0months) for group 2. The 3-year OS was 71% in group 2 \\nand 53% in group 1. In conclusion, P is an important agent in IBC therapy. The \\n3-year OS for patients with ER-negative tumors in groups 1 and 2 was 43% and \\n71%, respectively (32\\xa0months and 54\\xa0months, respectively (P\\xa0=\\xa00.03)); progression- \\nfree survival (PFS) was 31% and 39%, respectively (18 and 27\\xa0 months, respec-\\ntively; P\\xa0=\\xa00.04). Taxanes are clearly more effective, particularly in ER-negative \\ntumors. The pCR ratio was 10% in the FAC-only group and 25% in the anthracy-\\ncline- P group; this difference was statistically significant (P\\xa0=\\xa00.012).\\nA retrospective analysis substantiated these findings using data from 308 IBC \\npatients who were observed between 1980 and 2000\\xa0in a study performed in England \\n[57]. In the 1990s, taxane-containing chemotherapy regimens (AP, cisplatin, P) \\nwere superior to anthracycline-containing chemotherapy regimens in terms of the \\n10-year BCSS (43.7% and 23.6%, respectively, P\\xa0=\\xa00.03).\\nIn the GeparTrio trial, an anthracycline and taxane combination (docetaxel/\\ndoxorubicin/cyclophosphamide (TAC)) was used as NACT [58]. Participants were \\nstratified by stage (93 IBC, 194 LABC, and 1777 operable breast cancers) and ran-\\ndomized to arms with six or eight cycles of TAC or two cycles of TAC followed by \\nfour cycles of vinorelbine/capecitabine chemotherapy. pCR rates and ORRs were \\nnot significantly different between IBC and LABC patients (8.6% vs. 11.3% for \\npCR, respectively; 71% vs. 69.6% for ORR, respectively) but were significantly \\nlower compared with operable breast cancer (17.7% and 83.4%, respectively; \\nP\\xa0=\\xa00.002 and P\\xa0<\\xa00.001, respectively). In IBC patients, there was a nonsignificant \\ntrend toward higher pCR rates with a response at midcourse in patients who received \\neight cycles of TAC compared with those patients who received only six cycles \\n(17.2% vs. 3.3%; P\\xa0=\\xa00.103).\\n11 Inflammatory Breast Cancer 287\\nThese studies demonstrate that anthracyclines and taxanes are important and \\nnecessary as primary chemotherapies for IBC. pCR rates are higher with the use of \\nweekly paclitaxel regimens [59, 60]. The optimal dosage and sequence of \\nanthracycline- taxane remain under investigation (taxane first followed by anthracy-\\ncline, anthracycline first followed by taxane, or an anthracycline-taxane \\ncombination).\\n Other Chemotherapies\\nDose-dense chemotherapy and high-dose chemotherapy with stem cell support may \\nbe effective for some selected patient groups. Survival advantages were observed in \\nsmall, phase II studies (3–4\\xa0year DFS of 45–65% and OS of 52–89%), but because \\nthere have been no prospective, randomized studies of these protocols, they are not \\nstandard and are not suggested except in clinical research trials [1, 2, 45, 61–67].\\nAn international expert panel on IBC recommended a minimum of six cycles of \\nPSC be administered over a course of 4–6\\xa0months before surgery [6]. If the response \\nis insufficient, different CT regimens or RT can be applied [6, 8]. RT is applied after \\nsurgery, and if the CT program is not completed before surgery, it should be com-\\npleted during the postoperative period.\\n Targeted Therapies\\n Anti-HER2 Therapies\\nThe HER2 positivity ratio in IBC is very high and varies between 42% and 57% \\n[1–4, 37, 38]. HER2 positivity is important for the prognosis of non-IBC, but its \\nimportance for IBC is not known. A retrospective study that included 179 stage III \\nIBC patients determined that HER2 positivity or negativity is not related to \\nrelapse- free survival (RFS) [68]. Another study of more than 2000 patients con-\\nducted in California demonstrated improved breast cancer-specific survival \\n(BCSS) in HER2-p ositive patients compared to HER2-negative patients (HR, \\n0.82; 95% CI 0.68–0.99) [69].\\nAlthough the prognostic importance of HER2 for IBC is not known, HER2 posi-\\ntivity is important for predicting the response to anti-HER2 therapies in HER2- \\npositive patients. Trastuzumab (Tr) is a monoclonal antibody against HER2 and the \\nfirst of the anti-HER2 agents. The addition of Tr to anthracycline- and taxane- \\ncontaining PSC regimens yielded a significantly increased response and improved \\nsurvival compared to non-Tr PSC regimens [5, 67, 69–74]. The increase in the pCR \\nrate from 17% to 62.5% was also statistically significant. Unfortunately, the studies \\nincluded many LABC cases and fewer IBC cases. Studies including only IBC cases \\nare very rare.\\n288 N. Guler\\nDawood et\\xa0al. reported that the pCR rate was 62.5% in HER2+ IBC cases receiv-\\ning NACT combined with Tr therapy, and the 2-year PFS was 59.4% [74]. In that \\nstudy, 3 of the 16 IBC patients had metastatic disease at the beginning of treatment. \\nForty-eight HER2+ LABC (IBC-containing) patients were enrolled in a study by \\nHurley et\\xa0al. [75]. Docetaxel-cisplatin-Tr was applied as induction therapy. After \\nchemotherapy, surgery, adjuvant chemotherapy and radiotherapy were performed \\nconsecutively. OS was 100% in patients with pCR.\\xa0In patients with residual disease \\nafter NACT, the OS rate ranged from 76% to 83%.\\nIn another study including 9 IBC and 22 LABC patients, docetaxel and Tr were \\napplied as the primary chemotherapy, and the CR rate was 40% [76].\\nThe NOAH (neoadjuvant Herceptin) trial was a prospective, open-label, phase 3, \\nmulticenter, randomized study [77]. HER2-positive, locally advanced (n\\xa0=\\xa0174) or \\nIBC (n\\xa0=\\xa061) cases were enrolled in the study. The patients received anthracycline- \\nbased and taxane-based NACT alone or with 1\\xa0year of Tr (concurrently with NACT \\nand continued after surgery). A parallel group with HER2-negative disease was \\nincluded and received NACT alone. The relapse, progression, and mortality risks \\nwere statistically significantly decreased in the Tr group compared with the CT-only \\ngroup. The pCR ratio was twofold higher in the Tr group than in the CT-only group \\n(38% and 19%, respectively). After a median follow-up of 5.4\\xa0years, the event-free \\nsurvival (EFS) benefit of the addition of Tr was maintained in patients with HER2- \\npositive disease [78]. The 5-year EFS was 58% in the Tr group and 43% in the CT \\ngroup (HR, 0.64; 95% CI 0.44–0.93; P\\xa0=\\xa00.016). Similarly, during that time period, \\nEFS was strongly associated with pCR in patients who received Tr. In that study, \\n27% of HER2(+) patients had IBC. The 3-year EFS was 70.1% in the Tr group and \\n53.3% in the CT-only group (P\\xa0=\\xa00.0007). The pCR (complete disappearance of the \\ntumors from both the breast and lymph nodes) rate was 48% in the Tr group and \\nonly 13% in the CT-only group (P\\xa0=\\xa00.002) [79].\\nTr should be started in the induction chemotherapy period for the treatment of \\nHER2-positive LABC or IBC patients. Although there has been no prospective ran-\\ndomized study, Tr therapy should be extended to 1\\xa0year. An anthracycline-Tr com-\\nbination is not suggested because of enhanced cardiotoxicity [5, 6, 8].\\nLapatinib is another anti-HER2-targeted drug (reversible dual inhibitor of both \\nHER1 and HER2), and studies with lapatinib or lapatinib with paclitaxel are ongo-\\ning [80–82]. The clinical RR was 80% for 21 IBC patients who received a lapatinib- \\npaclitaxel combination [81]. In one multicenter, open-label, phase II study with 49 \\nIBC patients, a lapatinib-paclitaxel combination was used as NACT [82]. Patients \\nwere divided into two groups: cohort A was positive for HER2 2+ or 3+ by immu-\\nnohistochemical (IHC) methods or FISH (fluorescence in situ hybridization)\\xa0±\\xa0epi-\\ndermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) expression; cohort B was HER2 negative/\\nEGFR positive. HER2 3+ or FISH-positive patients were analyzed separately. First, \\npatients received lapatinib for only 14\\xa0days, followed by 12\\xa0weeks of lapatinib and \\npaclitaxel weekly. Cohort B was stopped because of slow enrollment and a lack of \\nefficacy in IBC patients with HER2-negative/EGFR-positive tumors enrolled in a \\nparallel study, EGF103009. Thirty-five patients completed the study and underwent \\nsurgery. The pCR rate of cohort A was 18.2%, and the clinical RR was 78.6% for all \\n11 Inflammatory Breast Cancer 289\\ngroups and 78.1% in the HER2 3+ group. The clinical RR was 31% in the HER2- \\npositive group receiving only lapatinib, and the pCR rate was 17.6% in all patients \\nwho underwent surgery after therapy. The most common side effects of lapatinib \\nwere diarrhea and skin eruptions. Lapatinib is currently suggested only for clinical \\nresearch studies and not for routine clinical applications, and it should only be \\nadministered to patients who have HER2-positive BC.\\nIn one German randomized, phase III trial (GeparQuinto, GBG 44 trial), lapatinib \\nversus trastuzumab in combination with neoadjuvant anthracycline-taxane-b ased \\nchemotherapy were compared in the neoadjuvant setting [83]. IBC cases were also \\nincluded in the study (83 patients had T4d disease). A total of 620 patients were \\nrandomly assigned in a 1/1 ratio to receive neoadjuvant therapy with four cycles of \\nEC (epirubicin\\xa0+\\xa0cyclophosphamide) every 3\\xa0weeks and four cycles of docetaxel (D) \\nwith either Tr (every 3\\xa0weeks for eight cycles) or lapatinib (L: 1000–1250\\xa0mg/day \\nthroughout all cycles) before surgery. Of the 620 patients, 309 received ECTr-DTr, \\nand 311 received ECL-DL.\\xa0The pCR rate was 30.3% in the ECTr-DTr group and \\n22.7% in the ECL-DL group. The difference was statistically significant (P\\xa0=\\xa00.04). \\nThis study demonstrated that the pCR rate was significantly lower in the lapa-\\ntinib\\xa0+\\xa0CT group compared to the Tr\\xa0+\\xa0CT group. The investigators concluded that \\nunless long-term outcome data showed different results, lapatinib should not be used \\noutside of clinical trials as a single anti-HER2 treatment in combination with NACT.\\nIn one prospective randomized study, a lapatinib plus Tr combination was com-\\npared to Tr and lapatinib (NeoALTTO trial) [84]. Only early breast cancer patients \\nwere enrolled in this study. The NeoALTTO trial demonstrated that dual anti-HER2 \\ninhibition with Tr\\xa0+\\xa0lapatinib combined with weekly P significantly increased the \\nproportion of patients achieving pCR (51.3%; 95% CI 43.1–59.5) in the combina-\\ntion group compared with Tr alone (29.5%; 95% CI 22.437.5) and lapatinib alone \\n(24.7%; 95% CI 18.132.3). The difference was statistically significant (P\\xa0=\\xa00.0001). \\nEFS and OS did not differ between treatment groups. However, the 3-year EFS and \\n3-year OS were significantly improved in women who achieved pCR (HR 0.38, \\nP\\xa0=\\xa00.0003, and HR 0.35, P\\xa0=\\xa00.005, respectively) [85]. The findings from this study \\nconfirmed that pCR after neoadjuvant anti-HER2 therapy is an important prognostic \\nfactor for survival.\\nThe NeoSphere study was a multicenter, open-label, phase II randomized trial. \\nIBC cases (29 of 417 patients) were also enrolled in this study. Tr and another anti- \\nHER2 targeted agent, pertuzumab, were used during the preoperative CT period \\n[86]. The pCR ratio was higher in the pertuzumab\\xa0+\\xa0Tr\\xa0+\\xa0docetaxel combination arm \\nthen in the Tr\\xa0+\\xa0docetaxel combination arm (39.3% vs. 21.5%; p\\xa0=\\xa00.0063). The \\nTRYPHANEA study, a phase II cardiac safety study, was a randomized, three-arm \\nstudy [87]. Overall, 225 HER2-positive LABC, IBC and operable breast cancer \\npatients were enrolled in the study. In the first arm, 5-fluorouracil, epirubicin, cyclo-\\nphosphamide [FEC]\\xa0 +\\xa0 trastuzumab (H)\\xa0 +\\xa0 pertuzumab (P) was followed by \\ndocetaxel\\xa0+\\xa0H\\xa0+\\xa0P.\\xa0In the second arm, FEC only was followed by docetaxel\\xa0+\\xa0H\\xa0+\\xa0P.\\xa0In \\nthe third arm, a docetaxel\\xa0+\\xa0carboplatin\\xa0+\\xa0H\\xa0+\\xa0P combination was administered. The \\npCR ratio was similar in all treatment groups but was the highest in the third arm \\n(66.2%). After these two studies, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved \\n290 N.

A total of 29 patients were randomized to afatinib (n\\xa0=\\xa010), lapa-\\ntinib (n\\xa0=\\xa08), or trastuzumab (n\\xa0=\\xa011). These drugs were administered for a duration \\nof 6\\xa0weeks until the patients underwent surgery. The ORR was determined for eight \\nafatinib-, six lapatinib-, and four trastuzumab-treated patients. Drug-related adverse \\nevents were recorded in all afatinib-treated patients and commonly included diar-\\nrhea, acneiform dermatitis, and paronychia. Diarrhea and rash were documented in \\nsix of eight lapatinib-treated patients. The authors concluded that afatinib demon-\\nstrated more favorable clinical activity than lapatinib and trastuzumab did for neo-\\nadjuvant treatment of HER2-positive LABC and IBC.\\n Antiangiogenic Therapies\\nVascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) expression is increased in IBC. \\nTherefore, anti-angiogenic drugs have been suggested as therapy targets. The anti- \\nangiogenic drug bevacizumab has been used together with chemotherapy in \\n11 Inflammatory Breast Cancer 291\\ninduction therapy but did not meet expectations [1–4, 48, 71, 90, 91]. NCI-0173 \\nwas a small, phase II study that included 21 patients and assessed the efficacy of \\ndoxorubicin and docetaxel combined with bevacizumab in the preoperative treat-\\nment of LABC/IBC cases [92]. The clinical RR was 67%, and the pCR rate was \\n5%. The BEVERLY-2 study was a multicenter, one-armed, open-label, phase II \\nstudy performed in France with HER2-positive non-metastatic IBC patients [93]. \\nFirst, four cycles of a FEC-bevacizumab combination were applied, followed by \\nfour cycles of a docetaxel-bevacizumab-Tr combination every 21\\xa0days. Forty-two \\n(8%) of 52 patients completed eight cycles of therapy, and 49 patients (94%) under-\\nwent surgery. The pCR rate was 63.5%. The 3-year DFS rate was 68%, and the OS \\nrate was 90%; the 3-year DFS rate for patients who achieved pCR was 80%. \\nAstheny and vomiting were reported as the most common side effects. In the other \\npart of this study, the numbers of circulating tumor cells (CTCs) and circulating \\nendothelial cells (CECs) were counted before the study began, at the fifth cycle, \\nbefore surgery, during the postoperative period, and during the first year [94]. The \\n3-year DFS was 95% in patients with pCR, and these patients were CTC-free after \\ntreatment. For baseline (before treatment) patient CTC numbers of <1 and >1, \\n3-year survival was 81% and 43%, respectively; this difference was statistically \\nsignificant (P\\xa0=\\xa00.01). Prognostic importance was not detected for CEC.\\xa0This study \\nis important in terms of demonstrating the prognostic effect of CTC.\\xa0 In another \\nstudy, CTCs were determined to be a strong predictor of worse prognosis in patients \\nwith newly diagnosed IBC [95].\\nSemaxanib (SU5416) is an organic small receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor that \\ninhibits VEGF-mediated signaling through VEGFR2. The effectiveness of a doxo-\\nrubicin and semaxanib combination was investigated in 18 stage IIIB and IBC \\npatients in a phase IB study [96]. Median survival has not yet been provided. After \\ntreatment, the density of microvessels and blood flow through the tumor decreased. \\nNeutropenia was reported as a factor in dose-limiting toxicity. Congestive heart \\nfailure was monitored in four patients (22%).\\nAntiangiogenic drug studies continue with pazopanib, a new multi-targeted tyro-\\nsine kinase inhibitor.\\n New Targets\\nThere are many ongoing targeted therapy drug studies (p53 gene therapy, p53 stabi-\\nlizer agents, proteasome inhibitors, Tie-2 kinase inhibitors, E-cadherin inhibitors, \\nphosphatidyl-inositol-3-kinase inhibitors, farnesyltransferase inhibitors, etc.) [1–4, \\n44, 48, 71, 90, 91]. p53 mutations are associated with decreased responses to CT \\nand decreased survival outcomes.\\nEGFR overexpression occurs in 30% of IBC cases. Mortality risk is increased \\nwith increased expression of EGFR and chemokine receptors (CXCR4 and CCR7) in \\nIBC [97]. The 5-year OS was 24.8% in an IHC analysis of CXCR4-positive patients \\nand 42.3% in the negative group. The 5-year OS was 20% in an IHC analysis of \\n292 N. Guler\\nCCR7-positive patients and 41.9% in the negative group. These genes have been \\nannounced as new targets for therapy. The effectiveness of the human-EGFR anti-\\nbody panitumumab and chemotherapy (nanoparticle paclitaxel and carboplatin) \\ncombination will be investigated in HER2-negative IBC cases during the preopera-\\ntive period.\\nA deficiency in the Ras signaling pathway member low-affinity insulin-like \\ngrowth binding protein (LIBC/WINT1) and overexpression of Ras homolog gene \\nfamily member C (RhoC) guanosine triphosphatase (GTPase) have been established \\nin IBC [98]. In situ hybridization analysis of paraffin blocks demonstrated that \\nLIBC deficiency was 80% in IBC cases and 21% in non-IBC cases (P\\xa0=\\xa00.0013). \\nThe RhoC GTPase overexpression rate was 90% in IBC cases and 38% in non-IBC \\ncases (P\\xa0 =\\xa0 0.0095). These genes may be a target for the treatment of IBC. \\nFarnesyltransferase inhibitors (FTIs) inhibit RhoC and angiogenesis. FTIs have \\nbeen investigated for IBC. The FTI tipifarnib (T) enhances the antitumor effects of \\nchemotherapy in\\xa0vitro, has activity in metastatic breast cancer, and enhances the \\npCR rate of neoadjuvant AC chemotherapy. In one phase I-II trial, T plus weekly P \\nand 2-week AC CT were tested as a neoadjuvant treatment for HER2-negative ER \\nand/or PR-positive LABC (stratum A: 33 patients) and IBC (stratum B: 22 patients) \\nirrespective of ER/PR expression [99]. The breast pCR rate was 18% in stratum A \\nand 4% in stratum B.\\xa0These results are insufficient to indicate the use of FTIs for the \\nneoadjuvant treatment of IBC.\\nAnaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) gene amplification or overexpression may \\noccur in IBC [100, 101]. IBC patients are currently being evaluated for the presence \\nof ALK genetic abnormalities and, when eligible, enrolled into clinical trials evalu-\\nating ALK-targeted therapies (the small-molecule dual tyrosine kinase cMET/ALK \\ninhibitor crizotinib).\\n Endocrine Therapies\\nER and PgR negativity are higher in IBC than in other types of breast cancer [1–4, \\n32, 33]. Some studies have reported that up to 83% of IBC tumors are ER negative \\n[102, 103]. HR negativity is associated with a more aggressive clinical course, \\nshorter survival, and poor prognosis. The median survival for HR-positive IBC is \\nsuperior to that of HR-negative IBC according to the SEER data (4 vs. 2\\xa0years; \\nP\\xa0=\\xa00.0001) [13].\\nThere are no studies of neoadjuvant hormonal therapy in primary IBC. \\nAntiestrogen therapy should be applied after induction therapy and adjuvant che-\\nmotherapy are completed for HR-positive patients [6, 8]. Antiestrogen therapy \\nshould include either tamoxifen (±ovarian suppression) or an aromatase inhibitor \\ndepending on the patient’s menopausal status. The minimum period for use is \\n5–7\\xa0years.\\nThe anti-inflammatory and cholesterol-lowering effects of statins suggest they \\nmay have antitumor effects as well. The effect of statins on IBC was determined in \\n11 Inflammatory Breast Cancer 293\\na cohort study conducted by MDACC [104]. PFS was improved in patients who \\nreceived hydrophobic statins (atorvastatin, pravastatin, rosuvastatin) (HR, 0.49; \\n95% CI 0.28–0.84; P\\xa0<\\xa00.01). No significant response was observed in patients who \\nreceived lipophilic statins (fluvastatin, lovastatin, simvastatin). The mechanism of \\nthis effect is not known. Double-blind, prospective randomized studies are needed \\nto explain this effect.\\n Monitoring the\\xa0Response to\\xa0Treatment\\nThe international IBC consensus panel recommends that monitoring of the response \\nto PSC entails a combination of physical examination and imaging techniques [6]. \\nPhysical examination of the breast and regional lymph nodes for response may be \\nconducted every 6–9\\xa0weeks [105]. The breasts are usually photographed during the \\nexamination because the response to treatment can be monitored by the reduction in \\nerythema and edema [106]. After completing therapy, radiological evaluation should \\nbe performed and compared with the initial examination data. If necessary, radio-\\nlogical evaluation can be performed in the middle of the treatment course to confirm \\nor refute the clinical findings.\\nMammography and USG are recommended for radiological evaluation. MRI \\nmay be a better option to evaluate the response to therapy if it is available and \\naffordable [5, 6]. In one trial, FDG-PET/CT was used to evaluate the response to \\nNACT [107]. Thirty-two patients were included in the study. In patients with CR \\naccording to PET/CT imaging, only 26% had pCR.\\xa0In conclusion, more research is \\nneeded on the use of PET/CT to evaluate the response to therapy.\\n Follow-Up After Therapy\\nAfter the completion of treatment, regular history, physical examination, and mam-\\nmography are recommended for follow-up by the American Society of Clinical \\nOncology (ASCO) and the European Society of Medical Oncology (ESMO) [108, \\n109]. Physical examinations should be performed at 3- to 6-month intervals for the \\nfirst 3\\xa0years, every 6–12\\xa0months for years 4 and 5, and annually thereafter. Yearly \\nmammography of the other breast is suggested by ASCO [108]. The examination of \\nlocal lymph nodes with yearly USG has been suggested, although the data are insuf-\\nficient [6]. Genetic consultations are particularly important for patients with a fam-\\nily history of breast and ovarian cancer [8]. Prophylactic contralateral mastectomy \\nshould not be performed unless there are risk factors that make this obligatory. \\nRoutine performance of other radiological examinations, blood tests, and tumor \\nmarkers are not suggested in asymptomatic patients. Distant metastases are com-\\nmon during the follow-up period of the disease. Metastasis was observed in 203 \\nof 478 stage III IBC patients at a median observation time of 29\\xa0months [110]. \\n294 N. Guler\\nThe most common metastasis locations were the bone (28%), lung (21%), liver \\n(21%), and CNS (21%). CNS metastasis was most frequent in HER2-positive and \\ntriple- negative subtypes, as with non-IBC subtypes (P\\xa0=\\xa00.001).\\n Conclusion\\nMultimodal therapy (PST, surgery, and radiotherapy) is the main treatment method \\nfor IBC [1–6, 8, 111] (Fig.\\xa011.1). Currently, anthracycline- and taxane-containing \\nchemotherapy protocols as PSC are preferred (with the addition of trastuzumab in \\nHER2+ patients). Following PSC, surgical assessment is suggested. A modified \\nradical mastectomy can be performed in patients with recovered skin eruption. \\nNext, adjuvant RT is applied. In patients with no response to PSC, additional sys-\\ntemic CT and/or preoperative RT is planned.

The work-up for in situ carcinomas \\nincludes patient history, physical examination, bilateral mammography and careful \\nreview of pathology. Estrogen receptor (ER) positivity should be assessed in DCIS \\nbut is not recommended in LCIS patients. Breast MRI is not currently a routine \\nwork-up examination for in situ carcinomas but may be useful for selected patients.\\n Lobular Carcinoma In\\xa0Situ\\nLCIS or lobular neoplasia cells resemble cancer cells growing in the lobules of \\nbreast tissue that do not spread beyond the walls of the lobules. LCIS develops only \\nin the female breast. These cells contain a normal nuclear/cytoplasmic ratio. Mucoid \\nglobules in the cytoplasm are a characteristic feature. LCIS is usually an incidental \\nfinding on pathology specimens and is usually located near microcalcifications \\nlying in the adjacent tissue. LCIS is observed nearly ten times more often in white \\nwomen than African women. Women harboring LCIS can develop invasive breast \\ncancer in 25–35% of cases, and 65% of subsequent invasive breast cancer is ductal \\nin origin. Lobular neoplasia is considered a risk factor for invasive breast cancer in \\nH. Karanlik \\nDepartment of Surgical Oncology, Institute of Oncology, Istanbul University, Istanbul, Turkey \\nA.

The specimen should be evaluated with X-ray imaging. Radiation \\ntherapy after breast-conserving surgery is the standard treatment in DCIS. The disease-free surgi-\\ncal margin should be adequate. In cases undergoing BCS, a surgical margin of 2\\xa0mm or above is \\nconsidered safe only in those with DCIS. If the invasive tumor is <1\\xa0mm in DCIS, the surgical \\nborder safety is evaluated according to DCIS. If the invasive focus is >1\\xa0mm in DCIS, the surgical \\nmargin width should be evaluated according to the invasive cancer. A sufficient surgical margin \\nshould be decided together with clinical, radiological and pathological findings. The decision \\nregarding the “sufficient surgical margin” should be made according to findings such as additional \\nradiological foci (multiple foci, microcalcification), invasive lobular carcinoma, presence of more \\nthan one surgical margin and persistence of surgical marginal proximity in re-excision. bER- \\npositive, postmenopausal case, advanced age, low-grade tumors\\nboth breasts rather than a precursor lesion. Therefore, cancer can develop in either \\nbreast and not only the one harboring the lesion.\\nDisagreement exists about whether a surgical excision should be performed of \\nthe area of LCIS diagnosed by core needle biopsy. Most of the studies have shown \\nthat around 25% of patients with LCIS diagnosed by core needle biopsy will be \\nupgraded to having invasive cancer or DCIS after excisional biopsy [1]. Determining \\nof the subtypes of the LCIS based on core needle biopsy may be helpful to differen-\\ntiate patients who can be spared a surgical excision. Pleomorphic LCIS and/or mul-\\ntifocal/multicentric LCIS may behave similarly to DCIS; thus, surgical excision \\nwith negative margins may be considered (Fig.\\xa012.1) [2]. More than 4 foci of LCIS \\nmay also strengthen the possibility for upstaging on surgical excision. The usual \\ntype of LCIS found on core biopsy (affecting less than 4 terminal units in a single \\ncore), without imaging discordance, may be managed by radiological follow-up. All \\nLCIS patients should be counseled on risk-reduction strategies [1].\\n12 In Situ Cancer Treatment 305\\n Recommendations\\nPleomorphic LCIS and/or multifocal/multicentric LCIS may behave similarly to \\nDCIS; thus, surgical excision with negative margins may be considered.\\nIn asymptomatic women with LCIS, the routine use of bone scanning, liver ultra-\\nsonography and chest radiography cannot be recommended for baseline staging.\\n Ductal Carcinoma In\\xa0Situ\\nDuctal carcinoma in situ or intraductal carcinoma is considered non-invasive or pre- \\ninvasive breast cancer. The pathological appearance is the proliferation of cells lining \\nthe ducts, resulting in papillary growth within duct but without spreading beyond the \\nwalls of ducts to surrounding tissue. Early lesions do not harbor atypia or pleomor-\\nphism. The papillary growths (papillary growth pattern) then start to fill the lumen of \\nthe duct, and atypical cells have hyperchromasia and loss of polarity (cribriform \\ngrowth pattern). Eventually, these pleomorphic cells with mitosis obliterate the ducts \\n(solid growth pattern). Intensive growth causes necrosis at the center due to decreased \\nblood supply (comedo growth pattern). These necrotic centers contain calcium \\ndeposits and appear on mammograms. No spread or invasion occurs theoretically \\nbecause the cells cannot spread outside the breast tissue. DCIS is considered a pre-\\ncancer of high risk, as some cases may progress to become invasive cancer. Paget’s \\ndisease of the breast is characterized by eczema-form changes accompanied by ero-\\nsion and ulceration of the nipple and areolar epidermis. This condition is primarily \\ncorrelated with DCIS; additionally, it can be accompanied by invasive ductal carci-\\nnoma. The diagnosis is determined based on the microscopic observation of Paget \\ncells in a skin biopsy. The width of the lesion is evaluated via mammography and \\nMRI in patients for whom breast-conserving surgery is planned. \\nThe standard treatment for DCIS is breast-conserving lumpectomy with negative \\nsurgical margins (without axillary intervention) and whole-breast radiation [3]. If \\nnegative margins cannot be attained by breast-conserving surgery or if disease is \\nextensive (˃4\\xa0cm of disease or disease in more than one quadrant), mastectomy must \\nbe performed [4]. For non-palpable disease, needle localization or other image- \\nguided techniques are utilized to guide surgical resection. Specimen mammography \\nis usually performed for margin assessment.\\nPatients should be evaluated for hereditary breast cancer risk, and genetic coun-\\nseling should be provided to DCIS patients with high-risk features.\\nThe role of axillary staging in patients with DCIS is limited. The probability of \\na positive SLN is 7–9%, and most metastases are found as micrometastases or \\nisolated tumor cells [5, 6]. Nearly 20–40% of patients are diagnosed with a coin-\\ncidence of invasive cancer at needle core biopsy for the primary tumor, and the \\nrisk increases with palpable mass, poorly differentiated DCIS, younger age and \\nextensive disease [7, 8]. Sentinel node biopsy should be routinely performed in \\npatients with high-grade ductal carcinoma in situ who will undergo mastectomy \\n306 H. Karanlik and A. Igci\\nor for whom breast-conserving surgery will compromise the performance of a \\nfuture SLN biopsy because of wide excision in an anatomic location (e.g., tail of \\nthe breast) [9].\\nRe-excision is not required for surgical margins of 2–5\\xa0 mm in DCIS. \\nMultifocality and an increasing number of close or involved margins have been \\nidentified as predictive of additional disease on re-excision. These factors may be \\nsurrogate markers of an increased extent of disease. If the surgical margin is less \\nthan 1\\xa0mm at the skin or chest wall, boost radiation at a higher dose to the involved \\nsite should be provided instead of re-excision [10]. Recent consensus guidelines \\nissued jointly by the Society of Surgical Oncology and the American Society for \\nRadiation Oncology, which recommend “no ink on tumor” as the standard for an \\nadequate margin in invasive cancer, caution that these findings cannot be extrapo-\\nlated to DCIS [11].\\n Recommendations\\nThe routine use of bone scanning, liver ultrasonography and chest radiography can-\\nnot be recommended for baseline study in asymptomatic DCIS patients. Routine \\nMRI utility for breast assessment of DCIS patients is not recommended.\\nMRI may be performed in case of the following:\\n• Divergence among clinical examination, mammography and ultrasound\\n• Need for treatment planning due to difficulty in interpretation of disease extent \\n(both bilateral and multicentric disease).\\nIn case of multicentricity, lumpectomy is not recommended (Proposal 1).\\nThe standard treatment for DCIS is breast-conserving surgery with negative \\nsurgical margins (without axillary intervention) and whole-breast radiation \\n(Proposal 1).\\nIf negative margins cannot be attained by breast-conserving surgery for DCIS, \\nmastectomy must be performed.\\nPatients with high-risk DCIS should be evaluated for hereditary breast cancer, \\nand genetic counselling should be provided.\\nSentinel node biopsy should be routinely performed in patients with high-grade \\nDCIS\\n• who will undergo mastectomy and\\n• for whom BCS will not allow further SNB due to anatomic location (e.g., tail of \\nthe breast).\\nSurgical margins of at least 2\\xa0mm should be achieved.\\nRe-excision is not required for surgical margins of 2–5\\xa0mm.\\nEstrogen receptors and progesterone receptors should be tested in all DCIS \\npatients (Proposal 1).\\nImmediate breast reconstruction should be offered to all patients with DCIS \\ntreated with mastectomy (Proposal 1).\\n12 In Situ Cancer Treatment 307\\n Treatment\\nIf total mastectomy is performed with negative margins, adjuvant irradiation is not \\nrequired. When nipple-sparing mastectomy and reconstruction are performed, irra-\\ndiation of the nipple-areola complex is not standard. Breast tissue inadvertently left \\nunder the skin flaps should not be an indication for postoperative radiotherapy.\\nIn cases treated with BCS, adjuvant radiotherapy using partial-breast irradiation \\n(PBI) techniques is under investigation in randomized trials; such an approach is to be \\nconsidered “with caution” according to the American Society for Radiation Oncology \\nand other groups [12–14]. Intraoperative radiation therapy and electronic brachyther-\\napy should not be offered regardless of technique outside of clinical trial [12]. \\nLumpectomy without radiotherapy has been investigated in prospective and random-\\nized trials in patients considered to be at low risk of local recurrence [15, 16]. In such \\nlow-risk DCIS patients, whole-breast radiotherapy should be considered in the deci-\\nsion-making process with the patient, accounting for age, comorbidities, radiation risks, \\npatient preferences, and salvage options [17]. Radiotherapy following breast-conserv-\\ning surgery is optional in DCIS patients with low-risk features (>60\\xa0years of age, ER \\npositive, tumor diameter <1\\xa0cm, low grade, negative margins, no palpable mass) [18]. \\nFor a patient to be considered a low-risk DCIS case, the following criteria must be pres-\\nent: mammographic detection, no palpable mass, small tumor, ER positive, nuclear \\ngrade I or II, and clear surgical margins of at least 3\\xa0mm [17]. All other DCIS cases \\ntreated with lumpectomy are candidates for whole-breast irradiation [19–22].\\nThe marked reduction in recurrence rates following tamoxifen for 5\\xa0 years in \\nwomen with ER-positive DCIS reported by the NSABP B-24 trial resulted in \\nincreased use of tamoxifen as an adjuvant therapy. Despite this reduction ratio, \\n5-year tamoxifen is not routinely prescribed worldwide. The benefit of tamoxifen in \\nER-negative DCIS patients to reduce the risk of breast cancer recurrence after \\nbreast-conserving surgery and radiotherapy is uncertain, and tamoxifen should not \\nbe routinely recommended to ER-negative DCIS patients. Tamoxifen may be given \\nto reduce the contralateral breast cancer risk in ER-positive DCIS patients after \\nmastectomy (Tables 12.1 and 12.2) [23, 24].\\nTable 12.1 Adjuvant systemic therapy of ductal carcinoma in situ\\nRisk reduction treatment for the ipsilateral breast after breast-conserving surgery\\n Tamoxifen for 5\\xa0years:\\n  For ER- or PgR-positive patients who have undergone breast-conserving surgery (BCS) and RT\\n  Benefit of tamoxifen is not definite for ER-negative patients\\n  Patients treated with excision only\\n Aromatase inhibitor for 5 yearsa\\n   For ER-positive or PgR-positive postmenopausal patients who have undergone BCS and RT\\nRisk-mitigating treatment for the contralateral breast\\n Counseling for risk reduction\\naThe primary endpoint of NSABP B-35, a phase III trial comparing anastrozole to tamoxifen, each \\ngiven for 5\\xa0years, was breast cancer-free interval (BCFI), defined as the time from randomization \\nto any breast cancer (BC) event including local, regional, or distant recurrence or contralateral \\ndisease, invasive or DCIS. In conclusion, anastrozole provided a significant improvement com-\\npared to tamoxifen for BCFI, which was seen later in the study, primarily in women <60\\xa0years old. \\nIn the IBIS-II DCIS trial, anastrozole was shown to reduce recurrence, similar to tamoxifen\\n308 H.

There is evidence to support the \\nexistence of histologically aggressive variants of LCIS (e.g., “pleomorphic” LCIS), \\nwhich may have a greater potential than classic LCIS to develop into invasive lobu-\\nlar carcinoma. Surgeons may consider complete excision with negative margins for \\npleomorphic LCIS.\\nMost DCIS patients with limited disease may be treated with wide local excision \\nor with re-excision in which negative margins are achieved. Patients with wide-\\nspread disease (i.e., disease in two or more quadrants) require total mastectomy \\nwith SLN biopsy. Complete ALND is not recommended in the absence of proven \\naxillary metastatic disease in patients with apparent pure DCIS or mammographi-\\ncally detected DCIS with microcalcifications. However, a small proportion of \\nwomen with pure DCIS on initial biopsy will have invasive breast cancer at the time \\nof the definitive surgical procedure and thus will ultimately require ALN staging. In \\npatients with seemingly pure DCIS to be treated with mastectomy or with excision \\nin an anatomic location (e.g., tail of the breast), which could compromise the per-\\nformance of a future SLN biopsy, SLN biopsy may be considered. Endocrine ther-\\napy may be considered as a strategy to reduce the risk of ipsilateral breast cancer \\nrecurrence in women with ER-positive DCIS treated with breast-conserving ther-\\napy. The benefit of endocrine therapy for ER-negative DCIS is not established.\\n12 In Situ Cancer Treatment 309\\nReferences\\n 1.

At that time more extensive procedures \\nwere performed to prevent disease spread to distant sites. Halsted radical mastec-\\ntomy was the primary surgery with demonstrated improvements in survival. The \\nprocedure included removal of breast tissue with the overlying skin, underlying \\npectoral muscle and regional lymph nodes along the axillary vein. Halsted radical \\nmastectomy remained the mainstay of breast surgical therapy until the 1970s. The \\nmodern era brought the hypothesis of both centrifugal spread to adjacent structures \\nand lymphatic and blood vessel spread to distant sites, as many patients continued \\nto suffer disease despite such large resections.\\nBreast cancer treatment now includes local and regional approaches together \\nwith medical therapies designed to treat systemic disease. The combination of mul-\\ntimodality treatment options has brought improvements in survival rates.\\n Planning Surgery\\nBefore surgical treatment, the initial stage is to diagnose the disease. The primary \\nchoice for diagnosis is core biopsy. Excisional biopsy should be reserved for lesions \\nH.

Fine needle aspiration (FNA) is one choice but \\nhas high false-negative rates. In addition, FNA cannot distinguish invasive from in situ \\nlesions with high reliability. The biopsy should provide information about the tumor \\ntype, histological grade, lymphovascular invasion and hormone receptor status (ER, \\nPR, HER2). The history of the patient should be taken, and a proper physical exami-\\nnation should be performed. Adequate and appropriate imaging studies are necessary \\nto establish the extent of disease and to assign clinical stage. Patients with abnormal \\nblood tests or chest radiographs and patients with locally advanced or inflammatory \\nbreast cancer should undergo further investigation for distant metastases.\\nThe choice of treatment strategy is based on the tumor features (location and size \\nof tumor, number of lesions, extent of lymph node involvement) and biology \\n(pathology including biomarkers and gene expression) and on the age, general \\nhealth status, and personal preferences of the patient. Patients should be actively \\ninvolved in all management decisions. The possibility of hereditary cancer should \\nbe explored, and if needed, prophylactic procedures should be discussed following \\nappropriate genetic counseling and testing of the patient. In younger premenopausal \\npatients, possible fertility issues should be discussed, and guidance on fertility- \\npreservation techniques should be provided before initiation of treatment [1–11].\\nThe primary aim of breast cancer surgery is to eradicate the tumor and any local \\ndisease to achieve local control.

Patient preference \\nfor mastectomy and a desire not to receive radiotherapy are also acceptable indica-\\ntions for mastectomy. Contraindications for radiotherapy are previous breast or \\nchest wall irradiation, active lupus or scleroderma at the skin and pregnancy.\\nSimple and modified radical mastectomy both include removal of the gland \\ntogether with the nipple and areola. Complete axillary lymph node dissection is part \\nof modified radical mastectomy. An elliptical incision is planned for proper closure \\nof future skin flaps and to contain the nipple areola complex and previous biopsy \\nscars. Skin flaps are prepared, and glandular tissue is relieved. Breast tissue is sepa-\\nrated from the underlying pectoral muscle with the pectoral fascia left on the breast \\nspecimen. In case of modified radical mastectomy, dissection is continued towards \\nthe axilla, and the specimen involves level I and II axillary lymph nodes.

There is an increasing trend of combining plastic surgery \\ntechniques with breast cancer surgery to maximize cosmetic results. This so-called \\n“oncoplastic surgery” has been popularized to achieve the best aesthetic results with \\nadequate oncologic margins. The primary aim is to preserve breast appearance and \\nsymmetry as much as possible. Several deformities may occur after BCS depending \\non the location of the tumor and the amount of excised tissue. The final aesthetic \\noutcome may worsen with administration of radiotherapy, which may increase the \\ndeformity and make it more challenging to correct.\\nAxillary staging is usually performed through a separate incision. Sentinel lymph \\nnode biopsy is replacing axillary lymph node dissection in clinically node-negative \\npatients. Axillary dissection is similar for those requiring modified radical mastectomy.\\n13 Surgical Approach in\\xa0Invasive Breast Cancer 315\\nBreast-conserving therapy, axillary lymph node dissection, and whole-breast \\nirradiation are equivalent to mastectomy with axillary lymph node dissection as the \\nprimary treatment for most women with stage I and stage II breast cancers (Proposal \\n1) [12–15]. Both procedures result in similar overall survival and disease-free \\nsurvival.\\nBreast-conserving surgery is contraindicated for patients who are pregnant and \\nwould require radiotherapy during pregnancy; have diffuse disease that cannot be \\nremoved locally via a single incision with an acceptable cosmetic result; have wide-\\nspread suspicious or malignant-appearing microcalcifications on mammography; or \\nhave positive pathologic margins after surgery. Patients with pathologically positive \\nmargins should generally undergo re-excision to achieve negative pathologic \\n margins. If the margins remain positive after re-excision, mastectomy should be \\nperformed for optimal local control of the disease.\\nRelative contraindications to BCS include previous radiation therapy to the \\nbreast or chest wall; active connective tissue disease such as scleroderma and lupus \\ninvolving the skin; tumors greater than 5\\xa0cm, and focally positive pathologic mar-\\ngins. Those patients with focally positive pathologic margins who do not undergo \\nre-excision should be considered for a higher radiation boost dose to the tumor bed. \\nTo adequately assess margins following lumpectomy, surgical specimens should be \\noriented, and the pathologist should provide descriptions of the gross and micro-\\nscopic margin status and the distance, orientation, and type of tumor in relation to \\nthe closest margin. Careful histological assessment of resection margins is essential, \\nwith no tumor at the inked margin required. Marking the tumor bed with clips facili-\\ntates accurate planning of the radiation boost field where appropriate. Acceptably \\nlow local recurrence rates remain the major quality assurance target. Current guide-\\nlines recommend local recurrence rates after wide excision and radiotherapy of \\n<1% per year (with a target of <0.5%) and not exceeding 10% overall.\\nWomen undergoing BCS plus radiotherapy have been shown to have better body \\nself-image than those undergone mastectomy, but postoperative psychological well- \\nbeing has not been shown to differ between these groups [16].\\n Recommendations\\nAll patients with stage I or II breast cancer should be offered BCS or mastectomy \\n(Proposal 1).\\nThe surgery type should be tailored to the individual patient, who should be \\ninformed of all options and made aware that radiotherapy is required following BCS \\nand that further surgery is necessary in case of positive margins (Proposal 1).\\nThe patient should be aware of the advantages and harms of radiotherapy follow-\\ning BCS (Proposal 1).\\nMastectomy should be preferred to BCS in case of the following (Proposal 1):\\nInappropriate tumor-breast size ratio or tumor location interfering with cosmetic \\noutcome after BCS;\\n316 H.

Mutations in \\nthese genes predispose carriers to breast and ovarian cancer as well as melanoma \\nand prostate, bile duct and pancreatic cancers. They are inherited in an autosomal \\ndominant pattern and considered tumor suppressor genes. Rarer cases arise due to \\nLi Fraumeni Syndrome (p53 mutation), Peutz-Jeghers Syndrome (STK11/LKB1 \\ngene), Cowden Syndrome (PTEN gene), Hereditary Diffuse Gastric Cancer (HDGC; \\nCDJ-1 gene) and Ataxia Telangiectasia (ATM gene) and consist of less than 1% of \\nall breast cancer cases.\\nBoth BRCA genes are very large, and more than one hundred different mutations \\nhave been reported, including for which clinical significance has not been estab-\\nlished. Patients with these clinically unidentified significant mutations may or may \\nnot be at risk for cancer. In addition, not all mutations in certain sequences of BRCA1 \\nand 2 are identified by screening methods. Technically, negative screening results do \\nnot exclude the possibility of the presence of a mutation. Consequently, several esti-\\nmation models have been developed to aid clinicians in genetic counseling.\\nThe complexity of genetic testing necessitates clinical guidance from a special \\nhealth practitioner trained in and familiar with the field. A mutation is most likely to \\nbe identified in a family that includes patients who have already been diagnosed \\nwith breast or ovarian cancer. The screening method should be performed based on \\nthe patient with the youngest age of onset and who is less likely to have developed \\nsporadic cancer. If a mutation is identified, the remaining relatives and offspring can \\nbe screened with high accuracy. Relatives found not to carry the mutation bear the \\nsame risk as the general population, whereas unaffected relatives with the mutation \\nhave a greater risk than the general population and require surveillance and prophy-\\nlactic measures.\\nProphylactic strategies consist of prophylactic mastectomy, salpingo- \\noophorectomy and chemoprevention.\\n13 Surgical Approach in\\xa0Invasive Breast Cancer 317\\nOnly limited data are available on the survival impact of contralateral mastec-\\ntomy in unilateral breast cancer [17]. Women with breast cancer who are \\n≤35\\xa0years or premenopausal and carriers of a known BRCA1/2 mutation may be \\nrecommended additional risk-reduction strategies following appropriate risk \\nassessment and counseling. The lifetime risk of breast cancer in a BRCA1 carrier \\nis 80–85%, with a 10-year actuarial risk of contralateral breast cancer ranging \\nfrom 25% to 31%. With bilateral mastectomy, the risks for both subsequent breast \\ncancer incidence and mortality are reduced by 90–95%. The decision should be \\nmade with a multidisciplinary team before the surgery and should include a dis-\\ncussion of the risks associated with development of a contralateral breast cancer \\ncompared with the risks of recurrent disease from the primary cancer. Except as \\nspecifically outlined in some situations, prophylactic mastectomy of a breast con-\\ntralateral to a known unilateral breast cancer treated with mastectomy is discour-\\naged. The use of prophylactic mastectomy contralateral to a breast treated with \\nbreast- conserving surgery is very strongly discouraged in all patients.\\nDespite the overall trend toward breast conservation, increasing numbers of \\nbreast cancer patients are opting for bilateral mastectomy (incorporating contralat-\\neral risk-reducing surgery) in preference to breast conservation and mammographic \\nsurveillance of the irradiated breast. These patients should be counseled properly \\nand should be informed of the finding that patients with early-stage breast cancer \\nmight have even better outcomes after breast-conserving therapy compared with \\nafter mastectomy.\\n Recommendations\\nPatients from high-risk families (multiple affected family members, male breast \\ncancer, bilateral breast cancer, concomitant ovarian cancer, Ashkenazi Jewish, early \\nonset of breast cancer) should be referred to genetic counseling.\\nGenetic counselling should be undertaken by physicians with specific training.\\nPatients with a family history of breast cancer or known BRCA1 or 2 gene muta-\\ntions should be offered optional prophylactic mastectomy.\\nProphylactic salpingo-oophorectomy should also be offered.\\n Axillary Staging\\nAxillary surgery is required for adequate staging and proper treatment of breast \\ncancer. The primary aim is to eradicate local disease. Axillary surgery minimizes \\nlocal recurrence and influences survival and prognosis by guiding adjuvant therapy. \\nAxillary lymph node dissection (ALND) was a routine surgical procedure for breast \\ncancer treatment. ALND provides useful information for staging of disease while \\neradicating local disease. The procedure involves removal of lymph nodes in the \\naxillary fossa posterior to the pectoral minor muscle up to the axillary vein. The \\n318 H. Karanlik and A. Igci\\nlevel of axillary lymph node dissection is defined as I, II or III according to the loca-\\ntion of the lymph node basins removed relative to the pectoralis minor muscle. \\nUnfortunately, ALND is associated with serious morbidities, such as placement of \\naxillary drainage, longer hospitalization, recovery, postoperative pain and limita-\\ntions in arm and shoulder movement due to lymphedema.\\nSentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) was developed to reduce these morbidities \\nassociated with ALND while providing similar information on axillary status. The \\nsentinel lymph node is defined as the first lymph node to which tumor cells are \\nlikely to spread from the primary breast tumor. Patients with positive SLNB may \\nbenefit from ALND, and negative patients that will avoid the morbidities of ALND. \\nThe sentinel lymph node is localized via lymph node mapping. Mapping may be \\nperformed with blue dye (methylene blue or isosulfan blue) or technetium-labeled \\nsulfur colloid either alone or in combination. Several studies have demonstrated that \\nthe combination technique may result in lower false-negative rates. The mapping \\nagents may be injected in the subdermal, periareolar or peritumoral region. The \\nmapping agent(s) passes through the lymphatics and accumulates at the draining \\nnode. Then, the sentinel lymph node(s) are harvested if they are identified and then \\npathologically evaluated.\\nPreoperative lymphoscintigraphy may provide information on draining basins \\nand sentinel lymph node number. The procedure may be performed the day prior to \\nsurgery or on the day of surgery. Peritumoral injection may provide an image of \\ndrainage to the axillary, internal mammillary, or both nodal basins. If subareolar or \\nsubdermal injection is used, only axillary drainage is revealed. A lack of lymph \\nnode detection on lymphoscintigraphy prior to operation does not preclude success \\nof intraoperative detection. Preoperatively, blue dye is injected prior to incision in a \\nvolume of 3–5\\xa0 ml, and massage is performed to facilitate drainage. A handheld \\ngamma probe is used to detect radioactivity transcutaneously and guide incision. \\nAfter the incision is made, the increased radioactivity and blue lymphatic channel \\nguide the surgeon to the sentinel lymph node(s). After harvesting the node, the \\nregion is checked to confirm that the radioactivity has decreased. If not, the search \\ncontinues to other sentinel lymph node(s).\\nTrained physicians have been reported to identify sentinel lymph nodes in 95% \\nof cases with a less than 10% false-negative rate. Patients with clinically positive \\nlymph nodes should be evaluated with ultrasound and FNA biopsy prior to surgery. \\nIn case of confirmed axillary metastasis, patients may be directed to ALND or con-\\nsidered for neoadjuvant chemotherapy. If no axillary metastasis is demonstrated, \\npatients can proceed to SLNB.\\nSentinel lymph node (SLN) mapping and surgical excision of clinically lymph \\nnode negative axilla are recommended to evaluate the pathologic status of the axil-\\nlary lymph nodes in patients with stage I or stage II breast cancer [18–24]. This \\nrecommendation is supported by the results of randomized clinical trials showing \\ndecreased arm and shoulder morbidity such as pain, lymphedema and sensory loss \\nin patients with breast cancer undergoing SLNB compared with patients undergo-\\ning standard ALND [24, 25]. An experienced SLN team is mandatory for the use \\nof SLN mapping and excision [26, 27]. With appropriate training in the dual \\n13 Surgical Approach in\\xa0Invasive Breast Cancer 319\\nradiocolloid/blue dye or indocyanine green fluorescence technique, acceptably \\nlow false- negative rates and favorable axillary recurrence rates following SLNB \\nare achievable. Women who have invasive breast cancer and do not have access to \\nan experienced SLN team should be referred to an experienced SLN team for \\ndefinitive surgical treatment of the breast and surgical axillary lymph node stag-\\ning. Candidates for SLN mapping should have clinically negative axillary lymph \\nnodes or a negative fine-needle aspiration (FNA) biopsy of any clinically suspi-\\ncious axillary lymph nodes. There is no consensus for the pathologic assessment \\nof SLNB.\\xa0The significance of occult micrometastases in terms of surgical manage-\\nment and patient outcome appears to be negligible. Thus, routine IHC or PCR is \\nnot recommended for the evaluation of sentinel lymph nodes, and treatment deci-\\nsions should be made based on H&E staining [28].\\nMultiple attempts have been made to identify cohorts of women with involved \\nSLNs who have a sufficiently low risk of non-SLN involvement that complete axil-\\nlary dissection might be avoided if the SLN is positive. None of the early studies \\nidentified a low-risk group of patients with positive SLN biopsies but consistently \\nnegative non-sentinel nodes [29–34]. Nonetheless, a randomized trial (ACOSOG \\nZ0011) compared SLN resection alone with ALN dissection in women ≥18\\xa0years of \\nage with T1/T2 tumors, fewer than 3 positive SLNs, and undergoing breast- \\nconserving surgery and whole-breast irradiation. In this study, there was no differ-\\nence in local recurrence, DFS, or OS between the two treatment groups. Only \\nER-negative status, age <50, and lack of adjuvant systemic therapy were associated \\nwith decreased OS.\\xa0At a median follow-up of 9.3\\xa0years, 10-year locoregional recur-\\nrence did not differ significantly between the 2 groups. The 10-year OS was 86.3% \\nin the SLND alone group and 83.6% in the ALND group (p\\xa0=\\xa00.02) [35]. In addition \\nto this study, based on the results of the IBCSG 23–01 trial, further axillary treat-\\nment does not seem to be required when a sentinel node has micrometastasis \\n(0.2–2\\xa0 mm) [36]. Therefore, according to these results, patients with T1 or T2 \\ntumors with 1–2 positive SLNs and undergoing BCS plus tangential breast irradia-\\ntion may not require further axillary procedures. However, these results need to be \\nconfirmed and cannot be extended to patients with characteristics other than those \\nof the trial’s patient population.\\nLevel I or II axillary dissection should be recommended when (1) patients have \\nclinically positive nodes at the time of diagnosis that are confirmed by FNA or core \\nbiopsy or (2) sentinel nodes are not identified. Traditional level I and level II evalu-\\nation of axillary lymph nodes requires that at least 10 lymph nodes be removed for \\npathologic evaluation to accurately stage the axilla [37, 38]. Level III ALND should \\nbe performed only if gross disease is apparent in the level II nodes. Level I–II lymph \\nnode dissection should include tissue inferior to the axillary vein from the latissimus \\ndorsi muscle laterally to the medial border of the pectoralis minor muscle.\\nFurthermore, without definitive data demonstrating superior survival with ALND \\nor SLNB, these procedures may be considered optional in patients who have par-\\nticularly favorable tumors, patients for whom the selection of adjuvant systemic \\ntherapy will not be affected by the results of the procedure, elderly patients, and \\npatients with serious comorbid conditions. Patients with SLN metastasis and no \\n320 H. Karanlik and A.

Systemic chemotherapy \\nor hormonal therapy can result in breast tumor size reduction in nearly 80% of \\npatients with locally advanced breast cancer. Systemic therapy can convert inoper-\\nable tumors to operable ones and convert the need for a surgical procedure from \\nmastectomy to breast-conserving surgery, which will enable favorable cosmesis. \\nClinical trials are reporting better aesthetic results in early-stage breast cancer \\npatients. This approach also permits the study of tumor biology before surgery and \\nthe evaluation of the tumor response to chemotherapy regimens. At the end of sys-\\ntemic therapy, many patients may achieve complete pathological response in both \\nclinical examination and imaging studies. Consequently, the primary tumor site \\nshould be marked with a metallic clip prior to the initiation of chemotherapy to \\nindicate the original tumor site.\\nPreoperative systemic chemotherapy trials have gathered some informative defi-\\nnitions and knowledge of breast cancer in recent years. This knowledge has revealed \\ntumor and patient characteristics that can predict the response to therapy. \\nConsequently, patients can be better defined and selected for appropriate drug regi-\\nmens, and patients are obtaining greater benefit from the chemotherapy. Targeted \\ntherapies, such as the treatment of HER2-positive breast cancer patients with trastu-\\nzumab and pertuzumab in combination with chemotherapy, have led to increased \\nrates of pathologic complete response.\\nPrimary systemic chemotherapy (preoperative chemotherapy) should be consid-\\nered for women with large clinical stage IIA, stage IIB, and T3N1 tumors who meet \\nthe criteria for breast-conserving therapy except for tumor size and who wish to \\nundergo breast-conserving therapy (Figs.\\xa013.1 and 13.4).

Tumor biology or patient age (<40) does not \\nchange the minimum acceptable surgical margins. cFor BCS: If adjuvant whole-breast RT and \\nsystemic treatment will be given to the patient with macrometastasis in 1–2 sentinel lymph nodes, \\ncomplete axillary dissection may not be performed regardless of tumor biology. dFor mastectomy: \\nComplete axillary dissection should be performed in patients with macrometastases in 1–2 sentinel \\nlymph nodes if adjuvant RT is not planned. However, there is no complete consensus regarding the \\nomission of axillary dissection in patients for whom RT has been planned. ePositive margins (ink \\non invasive carcinoma or ductal carcinoma in situ) were associated with a twofold increase in the \\nrisk of ipsilateral breast tumor recurrence (IBTR) compared with negative margins. This increased \\nrisk was not mitigated by favorable biology, endocrine therapy, or a radiation boost. More widely \\nclear margins than no ink on tumor do not significantly decrease the rate of IBTR compared with \\n“no ink on tumor”. No evidence indicates that more widely clear margins reduce IBTR in young \\npatients or in those with unfavorable biology, lobular cancers, or cancers with an extensive intra-\\nductal component. The use of “no ink on tumor” is the standard for adequate margins in invasive \\ncancer but not in DCIS. During the operation, it is best to perform the incision macroscopically \\n1\\xa0cm around the tumor. Postoperative MR imaging is appropriate for patients with tumors in close \\nproximity to the surgical margin. In cases undergoing BCS, a surgical margin of 2\\xa0mm or greater \\nis considered safe only in those with DCIS. If the invasive tumor is <1\\xa0mm in DCIS, the surgical \\nborder safety is evaluated according to DCIS. If the invasive focus is >1\\xa0mm in DCIS, the surgical \\nmargin width should be evaluated according to the invasive cancer. An adequate surgical margin \\nshould be decided by clinical, radiological and pathological evaluation. A “sufficient surgical mar-\\ngin” should be decided according to findings such as radiological additional foci (multifocal dis-\\nease, microcalcification), invasive lobular carcinoma, multiple surgical margin involvement and \\npersistent proximity of surgical margins in re-excision. fNeoadjuvant chemotherapy is recom-\\nmended for patients with axillary lymph node-positive T1–T3 tumors and axillary lymph node- \\nnegative T2–T3 tumors with triple-negative or HER2-positive tumors. In other cases, axillary \\nlymph node positivity alone is not sufficient to make a decision regarding neoadjuvant treatment. \\nIn Luminal B tumors, chemotherapy can be considered a priority. Neoadjuvant hormone therapy \\nalone may be considered to avoid mastectomy in node-negative select patients (i.e., patients with \\nstrong hormone receptor positivity, advanced age, or poor performance status). Neoadjuvant hor-\\nmonotherapy should last for 6–8\\xa0months, as long as the patient responds. The addition of hormonal \\nagents to neoadjuvant chemotherapy can be made with a low level of evidence. Importantly, the \\nguidelines emphasize that addition of endocrine therapy is not based on direct evidence. \\nAdditionally, they provide no reason why endocrine therapy should be delayed until completion of \\ncytotoxic treatment. Tamoxifen as endocrine therapy should not be given with chemotherapy. \\nWhen neoadjuvant chemotherapy is given, the use of chemotherapy in high-risk patients with very \\nstrong hormone-receptor positivity, aromatase inhibitors in the postmenopausal stage, and medical \\noophorectomy in the premenopausal stage [± aromatase inhibitor, especially in HER2-positive \\npatients] may be considered (proposal 3). gIn a patient who is clinically node positive (N1) at pre-\\nsentation and is downstaged after chemotherapy, sentinel lymph node (SLN) biopsy is appropriate. \\nMarking of positive axillary nodes with a clip in the beginning of the chemotherapy should be \\nconsidered to permit verification that the biopsy-positive lymph node has been removed at the time \\nof definitive surgery. Among in these subgroup of patients, SLNB has a >10% false-negative rate \\nwhen performed after preoperative systemic therapy. This false negative rate can be improved by \\nmarking biopsied lymph nodes to document their removal, using dual tracer, and by removing \\nmore than 2 sentinel nodes. If SLN is positive, axillary lymph node dissection must be performed. \\nAfter downstaging, resection of the entire area of the original primary tumor is not necessary (if \\nthere is shrinkage in the tumor). MR imaging is recommended in patients who will undergo BCS \\nafter neoadjuvant therapy. Clinical examination and radiological imaging modalities (USG, MMG, \\nMR imaging) are used to evaluate the tissue to be excised (shrinking or patching). However, if the \\ntumor response is patchy, the original tumor area should be removed with clean surgical margins. \\nIf diffuse live tumor cells are observed in the excised lumpectomy specimen after neoadjuvant \\nchemotherapy, re-excision should be performed, even if there is no surgical margin involvement\\n324 H. Karanlik and A. Igci\\nreceive preoperative systemic therapy, core biopsy of the breast tumor and place-\\nment of image-detectable marker should be considered to demarcate the tumor bed \\nfor any future post-chemotherapy surgical management. Clinically positive ALN \\nshould be sampled by FNA or core biopsy, and positive nodes can be removed fol-\\nlowing preoperative systemic therapy at the time of definitive operation. Patients \\nwith clinically negative ALNs should undergo axillary ultrasound prior to neoadju-\\nvant treatment. For those with clinically suspicious ALNs, core biopsy or FNA of \\nthese nodes is indicated [40].\\nSentinel node biopsy or level I/II dissection can be performed as axillary staging \\nafter preoperative systemic therapy. Level I/II dissection should be performed when \\npatients are proven node positive prior to neoadjuvant therapy. The false-negative \\nrate of SLNB in either the pre- or post-chemotherapy settings is low [41–44]. \\nNevertheless, a pathologic complete response (pCR) following chemotherapy is \\npossible in lymph node metastases previously undetected by clinical exam. An SLN \\nexcision can be considered before administering preoperative systemic therapy \\nbecause it provides additional information to guide local and systemic treatment \\ndecisions. Close communication between members of the multidisciplinary team, \\nincluding the pathologist, is particularly important when any treatment strategy \\ninvolving preoperative systemic therapy is planned.\\nBecause complete or near-complete clinical responses are common, the use of \\npercutaneously placed clips in the breast under mammographic or ultrasound guid-\\nance aids post-chemotherapy resection of the original area of the tumor and is encour-\\naged. Breast conservation rates are higher after preoperative systemic therapy [45].\\nLocal therapy following a complete or partial response to preoperative systemic \\ntherapy is usually breast-conserving surgery if possible along with surgical axillary \\nstaging. If breast-conserving surgery is not possible or progressive disease is con-\\nfirmed, mastectomy is performed along with surgical axillary staging with or with-\\nout breast reconstruction. Surgical axillary staging may include SLN biopsy or level \\nI/II dissection. If SLN biopsy was performed before administering preoperative sys-\\ntemic therapy and the findings were negative, then further ALN staging is not neces-\\nsary. If an SLN procedure was performed before administering preoperative \\nsystemic therapy and the findings were positive, then a level I/II ALN dissection \\nshould be performed.\\nPatients with stage III disease may be further divided into (1) those in whom an \\ninitial surgical approach is unlikely to successfully remove all disease or to provide \\nlong-term local control; and (2) those in whom a reasonable initial surgical approach is \\nlikely to achieve pathologically negative margins and provide long-term local control. \\nThus, stage IIIA patients are divided into those with clinical T3N1 disease and those \\nwho have clinical T anyN2M0 disease based on evaluation by a multidisciplinary team.\\nIn patients with inoperable, locally advanced non-inflammatory disease, \\nanthracycline- based preoperative systemic therapy is standard therapy. Local ther-\\napy following a clinical response to preoperative systemic therapy usually consists \\nof mastectomy or breast-conserving surgery with level I/II ALN dissection [45–47]. \\nDelayed breast reconstruction can be considered in mastectomy patients.\\nPatients with a clinical/pathologic diagnosis of inflammatory breast cancer (IBC) \\nshould always be treated with preoperative chemotherapy [48, 49]. Primary surgery \\n13 Surgical Approach in\\xa0Invasive Breast Cancer 325\\nand SLN dissection is not a reliable approach in patients with IBC [50]. Breast- \\nconserving surgery is not recommended in IBC patients due to poor cosmesis and \\nhigher local recurrence rates compared with mastectomy.\\nThe use of breast-conserving surgery in patients with IBC has been associated \\nwith poor cosmesis, and limited data suggest that rates of local recurrence may be \\nhigher compared with mastectomy. Breast-conserving therapy is not recommended \\nfor patients with IBC.\\nMastectomy with level I/II ALN dissection is the recommended surgical proce-\\ndure for patients who respond to neoadjuvant chemotherapy. Delayed breast recon-\\nstruction is an option for patients with IBC who have undergone a modified radical \\nmastectomy. Early/immediate reconstruction after mastectomy may compromise \\npost-mastectomy radiotherapy outcomes [51].\\nFor patients with IBC who do not respond to preoperative systemic therapy, mas-\\ntectomy is not generally recommended. Additional systemic chemotherapy and/or \\npreoperative radiation should be considered for these patients, and patients respond-\\ning to this secondary therapy should undergo mastectomy and subsequent treatment \\nas described above.\\n Breast Reconstruction\\nBreast reconstruction may be an option for any woman receiving surgical treatment \\nfor breast cancer. Therefore, all women undergoing breast cancer treatment should \\nbe educated about breast reconstructive options adapted to their individual clinical \\nsituation. However, breast reconstruction should not interfere with the appropriate \\nsurgical management of the cancer.\\nBreast reconstruction consists of several surgical techniques utilizing either pros-\\nthesis or tissue from elsewhere in the body to rebuild breast shape. The use of \\nimplants, pedicled flaps or free flaps are the most commonly applied procedures. \\nBreast reconstruction can be immediate at the time of primary surgery or delayed to \\nallow time to recover from the primary surgery and subsequent adjuvant \\ntreatments.\\nThe decision regarding the type of reconstruction involves patient preference, \\nbody habitus, smoking history, comorbidities, plans for irradiation, and expertise \\nand experience of the reconstruction team. Reconstruction is an optional procedure \\nthat does not impact the probability of recurrence or death but is associated with an \\nimproved quality of life for many patients. It is sometimes necessary to perform \\nsurgery on the contralateral breast (e.g., breast reduction, implantation) to achieve \\noptimal symmetry between the ipsilateral reconstructed breast and the contralateral \\nbreast.\\nThe loss of the breast for cosmetic, body image, and psychosocial issues may be \\npartially overcome through the performance of breast reconstruction. Reconstruction \\ncan be performed either immediately following mastectomy and under the same \\nanesthetic or in a delayed fashion following mastectomy. Breast reconstruction usu-\\nally involves a staged approach requiring more than one procedure.\\n326 H. Karanlik and A. Igci\\nMany factors must be considered in decision making about breast reconstruction \\nfollowing mastectomy. Several different types of breast reconstruction, such as \\nautogenous tissues, implants, or both, can be performed following mastectomy [52–\\n54]. Reconstruction with implants can be performed either by immediate placement \\nof a permanent subpectoral implant or initial placement of a subpectoral expander \\nfollowed by replacement of the expander with a permanent implant. At 1\\xa0year after \\nmastectomy, patients who underwent autologous reconstruction were more satisfied \\nwith their breasts and had greater psychosocial and sexual well-being than those \\nwho underwent implant reconstruction. Although satisfaction with breasts was \\nequal to or greater than baseline levels, physical well-being was not fully restored \\n[54]. Autogenous tissue methods of reconstruction use various combinations of \\ndonor sites (e.g., abdomen, buttock) that may be brought to the chest wall with their \\noriginal blood supply or as free flaps with microvascular anastomoses to supply \\nblood from the chest wall/thorax. Several procedures using autologous tissue are \\navailable, including transverse rectus abdominis myocutaneous flap, latissimus \\ndorsi flap, and gluteus maximus myocutaneous flap reconstruction. Composite \\nreconstruction techniques use implants in combination with autogenous tissue \\nreconstruction to provide volume and symmetry. Patients with underlying diabetes \\nor who smoke tobacco have increased rates of complications following autogenous \\ntissue breast cancer reconstruction, presumably because of underlying microvascu-\\nlar disease.\\n Skin-Sparing Mastectomy\\nThe possible advantages of skin-sparing mastectomy include improvements in \\nbreast cosmesis, body image, and nipple sensation following mastectomy, although \\nthe impact of this procedure on these quality-of-life issues has not been well studied \\n[55–57]. There are limited data from surgical series with short follow-up suggesting \\nthat nipple-areolar complex (NAC)-sparing mastectomy in selected patients is asso-\\nciated with low rates of occult involvement of the NAC with breast cancer and local \\ndisease recurrence. NAC-sparing procedures may be an option in patients who are \\ncarefully selected by experienced multidisciplinary teams. Assessment of retroareo-\\nlar margins is mandatory in patients considering an NAC-sparing procedure [56, 58, \\n59]. Retrospective studies validate the use of NAC-sparing procedures for patients \\nwith breast cancer with low rates of nipple involvement and low rates of local recur-\\nrence due to early-stage, biologically favorable tumors that are located >2\\xa0cm from \\nthe nipple [60, 61]. Contraindications for nipple preservation include findings of \\nnipple involvement such as Paget’s disease or bloody nipple discharge. Ongoing \\nprospective trials to assess NAC-sparing mastectomy in the setting of malignancy \\nwill answer many questions, and participation in such trials is encouraged.\\nAlthough no randomized studies have been performed, the results of several ret-\\nrospective studies have indicated that the risk of local recurrence is not increased \\namong patients receiving skin-sparing mastectomies compared with those undergo-\\n13 Surgical Approach in\\xa0Invasive Breast Cancer 327\\ning non-skin–sparing procedures. However, strong selection biases almost certainly \\nexist in the identification of patients appropriate for skin-sparing procedures [62–\\n66]. Reconstruction of the NAC may also be performed in a delayed fashion if \\ndesired by the patient. Reconstructed nipples are devoid of sensation. Skin-sparing \\nmastectomy should be performed by an experienced breast surgery team working in \\na coordinated, multidisciplinary fashion to guide proper patient selection for skin- \\nsparing mastectomy, determine optimal sequencing of the reconstructive procedure \\nin relation to adjuvant therapies, and perform a resection that achieves appropriate \\nsurgical margins. Post-mastectomy radiation should still be applied for patients \\ntreated by skin-sparing mastectomy following the same selection criteria as for \\nstandard mastectomy.\\n Post-Mastectomy Radiation and\\xa0Breast Reconstruction\\nThe decision for post-mastectomy radiation therapy can affect reconstruction strate-\\ngies because of the increased risk of complications, such as capsular contracture, \\nfollowing irradiation of the implant. Postmastectomy radiation therapy may also \\nhave a negative impact on breast cosmesis when autologous tissue is used in imme-\\ndiate breast reconstruction [67, 68]. Some studies, however, have not found a sig-\\nnificant compromise in reconstruction cosmesis following irradiation [69]. While \\nsome experienced breast cancer teams have employed protocols in which immedi-\\nate tissue reconstructions are followed by radiation therapy, it is generally preferred \\nthat radiation therapy precede the placement of autologous tissue because of \\nreported loss of reconstruction cosmesis.\\nWhen implant reconstruction is planned in a patient requiring radiation therapy, \\na two-stage approach with immediate tissue expander placement followed by \\nimplant placement is recommended. Exchange of the tissue expanders with perma-\\nnent implants can be performed prior to radiation or after completion of radiation \\ntherapy. The expansion of irradiated skin can result in an increased risk of malposi-\\ntion, capsular contracture, poor cosmesis, and implant exposure. The use of tissue \\nexpanders/implants is relatively contraindicated in patients who have been previ-\\nously irradiated. Immediate placement of an implant in patients requiring postop-\\nerative radiation has an increased rate of complications such as capsular contracture, \\nmalposition, poor cosmesis, and implant exposure.\\n Recommendations\\nBreast reconstruction options should be offered for all patients undergoing \\nmastectomy.\\nImmediate and delayed reconstruction should be discussed prior to mastectomy \\ndue to the importance of self-confidence and body image perception.\\n328 H. Karanlik and A. Igci\\n Breast Reconstruction Following BCS (Oncoplastic Approach)\\nThe optimization of the cosmetic and oncologic outcomes of breast-conserving sur-\\ngery has been addressed in recent years by the emergence of the field of oncoplastic \\nsurgery. The possible cosmetic outcome of lumpectomy should be evaluated prior to \\nsurgery. Oncoplastic techniques for breast conservation can extend breast- \\nconserving surgical options in situations where the resection itself would likely \\nyield an unacceptable cosmetic outcome [70]. The definition of oncoplastic surgery \\nhas been recently expanded to include a wide range of volume displacement or vol-\\nume redistribution procedures performed by breast surgeons and general surgeons \\nto optimize breast shape and breast volume following breast cancer surgery [71]. \\nOncoplastic volume displacement procedures combine the removal of generous \\nregions of breast tissue with “mastopexy” techniques in which the remaining breast \\ntissues are shifted together within the breast envelope to fill the resulting surgical \\ndefect, thus avoiding the creation of a significant breast deformity. Volume displace-\\nment techniques are generally performed during the same operative setting as the \\nbreast-conserving lumpectomy by the same surgeon who is performing the cancer \\nresection [70–73].\\nThe advantages of oncoplastic volume displacement techniques include the abil-\\nity to remove larger regions of breast tissue, thus facilitating wider surgical margins \\naround the cancer, while better preserving the natural shape and appearance of the \\nbreast compared to standard breast resections [73].\\nThe limitations of oncoplastic volume displacement techniques include the lack \\nof standardization among centers, performance at only a limited number of sites, \\nand the possible need for subsequent mastectomy if pathologic margins are positive. \\nPatients should be informed of the possibility of positive margins and the potential \\nneed for secondary surgery, which could include re-excision segmental resection or \\nrequire mastectomy with or without loss of the nipple. Oncoplastic procedures can \\nbe combined with surgery on the contralateral unaffected breast to minimize long- \\nterm asymmetry.\\nFinally, it is important to note that the primary focus should be on treating the \\ntumor and that such treatment should not be compromised when decisions regard-\\ning breast reconstruction are made. In the first international consensus conference \\non standardization of oncoplastic breast conserving surgery the panelists consid-\\nered oncoplastic breast conserving surgery safe and effective for improving aes-\\nthetic outcomes and broadening the indication for breast conserving surgery \\ntowards larger tumors [74]. A slim majority believed that oncoplastic breast con-\\nserving surgery reduces the rate of positive margins; however, there was consensus \\nthat oncoplastic breast conserving surgery is associated with an increased risk of \\ncomplications compared to conventional breast conserving surgery. The panel \\nstrongly endorsed patient-reported outcomes measurement, and recommended \\nselected scales of the Breast-Q™-Breast Conserving Therapy Module for that pur-\\npose. The Clough bi-l evel classification was recommended for standard use in \\nclinical practice for indicating, planning and performing oncoplastic breast con-\\nserving surgery, and the Hoffmann classification for surgical reports and billing \\n13 Surgical Approach in\\xa0Invasive Breast Cancer 329\\npurposes. Mastopexy and reduction mammoplasty were the only two recognized \\noncoplastic breast conserving surgery procedure categories supported by a major-\\nity of the panel. Finally, the experts unanimously supported the statement that every \\noncoplastic breast conserving surgery procedure should be tailored to each indi-\\nvidual patient [74].\\n Surgery for\\xa0Metastatic Breast Cancer\\nThe primary treatment approach for women with metastatic breast cancer and an \\nintact primary tumor is systemic therapy, with consideration of surgery after initial \\nsystemic treatment for those women requiring palliation of symptoms or with \\nimpending complications, such as skin ulceration, bleeding, fungation, and pain \\n[75]. Generally, such surgery should be undertaken only if complete local clearance \\nof the tumor may be obtained and if other sites of disease are not immediately \\nthreatening to life. Radiation therapy may be considered as an alternative to surgery. \\nSurgery often requires collaboration between the breast surgeon and the reconstruc-\\ntive surgeon to provide optimal cancer control and wound closure.\\nRetrospective studies suggest a potential survival benefit from complete excision \\nof the primary tumor in select patients with metastatic breast cancer [76–81]. \\nSubstantial selection biases exist in all of these studies and are likely to confound \\nthe study results. Two recent prospective, randomized studies assessed whether or \\nnot surgery on the primary tumor in the breast is necessary for women who are \\ndiagnosed with metastatic breast cancer. The results from both studies were similar \\nand showed that surgical treatment of primary tumors in woman presenting with \\nstage IV disease does not produce an increase in OS in general [82, 83]. However, a \\nsurvival advantage for primary tumor excision was observed only in patients with \\nsolitary bone metastasis in the Turkish study [83].\\nRandomized clinical trials addressing the advantages and disadvantages of local \\ntherapy for patients with stage IV disease while eliminating selection biases are \\nnecessary. Patient enrollment in such trials is encouraged.\\n Conclusion\\nThe use of no ink on the tumor as the standard for an adequate margin in invasive \\ncancer in the era of multidisciplinary therapy is associated with low rates of IBTR \\nand has the potential to decrease re-excision rates, improve cosmetic outcomes, and \\ndecrease health care costs. Patients without sentinel lymph node (SLN) metastases \\nshould not receive axillary lymph node dissection (ALND). Patients with one to two \\nmetastatic SLNs planning to undergo breast-conserving surgery with whole-breast \\nradiotherapy should not undergo ALND (in most cases). Patients with SLN metasta-\\nses who will undergo mastectomy should be offered ALND according to randomized \\n330 H. Karanlik and A. Igci\\ncontrolled studies. Patients with operable breast cancer and multicentric tumors, with \\nductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) who will undergo mastectomy, who previously \\nunderwent breast and/or axillary surgery, or who received preoperative/neoadjuvant \\nsystemic therapy may be offered SLN biopsy. Women who have large or locally \\nadvanced invasive breast cancer (tumor size T3/T4), inflammatory breast cancer, or \\nDCIS (when breast-conserving surgery is planned) or are pregnant should not undergo \\nSLN biopsy. All women undergoing breast cancer treatment should be educated \\nabout breast reconstructive options, as adapted to their individual clinical situation. \\nThese recommendations are based on cohort studies and/or informal consensus.\\nReferences\\n 1.

Clinical staging is still used to \\ndetermine the tumor load. Tumor diameter and axillary involvement were used for \\na long time, and it is difficult for clinicians to abandon these customs. Consequently, \\ntumor diameter and axillary involvement are still considered important major prog-\\nnostic factors for predicting survival and selecting adjuvant treatment. Although \\naxillary evaluation [sentinel lymph node (SLN), axillary lymph node dissection \\n(ALND)] does not have a profound effect on overall survival (OS), the removal of \\nmetastatic lymph nodes from the axilla may contribute to locoregional control and \\nimprove quality of life. In the past, axillary staging with ALND was used in clini-\\ncally node-negative early-stage breast cancer patients; however, this method carries \\nthe risk of some arm and shoulder morbidity without any survival benefit. SLN \\nbiopsy (SLNB) is equivalent to ALND in clinically node-negative patients in terms \\nof staging, accuracy, disease-free survival (DFS), and OS.\\xa0Consequently, ALND is \\nnot currently advised for patients able to undergo SLNB.\\xa0SLNB examines the first \\nlymph nodes because the lymphatics of the breast drain to these lymph nodes, which \\ntherefore are the site most likely to be reached by tumor cells. If there is no cancer \\nmetastasis in the SLN, the other lymph nodes are considered clear (not containing \\ncancer cells); thus, the ALND technique has been abandoned.\\nM.

Muslumanoglu\\n Lymphatic Drainage of\\xa0the\\xa0Breast\\nThe lymphatics of the breast comprise interconnected superficial and deep lym-\\nphatic vessels. The subdermal plexus in the retroareolar space, which is called \\nSappey’s plexus, drains the lymphatics of the areola and nipple. The lymphatics of \\nthe interlobular connective tissue of the breast and the lymphatics of the walls of the \\nlactiferous channels also drain to this plexus. Efferent lymphatic channels leaving \\nthis plexus trace along the lateral border of the major pectoral muscle, penetrate the \\nclavipectoral fascia, and enter the axilla. Axillary lymph nodes collect nearly 75% \\nof the lymphatic drainage of the breast. The remaining lymphatics drain into the \\ninternal mammary (parasternal) lymph nodes (IMLNs) accompanying perforated \\nbranches of the internal mammary artery; this group generally receives drainage \\nfrom the medial part of the breast.\\n Sentinel Lymph Node Biopsy\\nSentinel means “sentry,” and the SLN is the first lymph node at which cancer cells \\narrive via lymphatic channels starting from the primary tumor; multiple SLNs may \\nexist. Because these lymph nodes are located on the lymphatic drainage course in \\nbreast cancer, they contain cancer cells when lymphatic metastasis has occurred. If \\nmetastasis is not detected in the pathological examination of the removed SLNs, the \\naxilla is considered clear, and ALND is not performed.\\nRadioactive colloid and/or blue dye can be used to detect the SLN. Recently, iron \\noxide nanoparticles and indocyanine green have been developed for SLNB using \\nthe same technique. SLNs that are identified by scintigraphic imaging in the preop-\\nerative phase can be detected intraoperatively using a gamma probe and/or by \\ninjecting blue dye into the breast tissue; the dyed channel and lymph node can then \\nbe detected and removed surgically. There are different practices regarding the \\nchoice of agents used (blue dye, radioactive substance, or both) and location of \\ninjection (periareolar, subareolar, peritumoral). Extra-axillary lymph node (internal \\nmammary group) excision is advised if it is identified as the first draining site by \\nlymphoscintigraphy.\\n Indications for\\xa0SLNB\\nSLNB has been accepted as a standard treatment approach in all clinically node- \\nnegative (with physical examination and imaging techniques) early stage (Figs.\\xa014.1 \\nand 14.2) breast cancer cases, regardless of tumor size (uni- or multiple) and loca-\\ntion (central, inner or outer part of the breast).\\n14 Evaluation of\\xa0Axillary Nodes 337\\nStage1 II, IIIA\\nClinically node positive at diagnosis\\nFNAB or Tru-cut FNAB or Tru-cut \\nbiopsy positive biopsy negative\\nNeoadjuvant Sentinel node \\ntreatment negative(a-c)\\nDo not perform \\nAxillary dissection supplemental surgery \\nlevel I/II (proposal 1)\\nFig. 14.1 Axillary management of patients with clinical node-positive stages II or IIIA.

Axillary \\ndissection is recommended for SLN-positive patients with triple-negative breast cancer\\n Contraindications for\\xa0SLNB\\nSLNB is contraindicated whenever a metastatic lymph node is clinically identified \\nin the axilla [1]. This increases the false-negative rate. Diffuse blockage of lym-\\nphatic channels in locally advanced breast cancers manifesting as inflammatory \\nbreast cancer and dermal edema are also contraindications for SLNB.\\nApproximately 40% of node-positive patients can be detected with preoperative \\nultrasonography and needle biopsy [2]. Classically ALND should be performed \\ndirectly in this case, or neoadjuvant chemotherapy may be recommended. However, \\nin the near future, axillary tumor load (one or multiple cortical asymmetries or cor-\\ntical enlargement of the LNs versus multiple gross positive LNs) will become \\nimportant for deciding further ALND.\\xa0 During surgery, whenever any suspicious \\nlymph nodes (hard) (non-SLNs) are palpated in SLNB-negative patients, excision \\n338 M.

Sometimes, core biopsy can cause enlargement and \\nstiffness in some of the axillary nodes, which may cause unnecessary LN excision \\ntogether with SLNB.\\xa0If metastasis is detected in SLNs or non-SLNs during paraffin \\nsection examinations, ALND or radiation therapy is decided in a multidisciplinary \\nmeeting for each patient according to all factors affecting locoregional recurrence \\nrisks and the benefits of adjuvant therapies.\\nBlue dye allergic reactions are observed in approximately 1–3% of cases and can \\ncause serious anaphylactic reactions [3]. Blue dye is not used during pregnancy due \\nto its potentially fatal effects [4]. Some studies have indicated that radioactive sub-\\nstances in low doses can be safely used during pregnancy [5–7].\\n14 Evaluation of\\xa0Axillary Nodes 339\\n SLNB in\\xa0Specific Cases\\n Ductal Carcinoma In\\xa0Situ\\nMetastasis is observed in 1–2% of DCIS cases, suggesting that some DCIS cases \\ncan indeed be invasive and that failure to diagnose metastasis is due to a pathologic \\nsampling error [8, 9]. Because invasive foci can be detected in paraffin sections and \\nSLNB is not associated with extensive complications, SLNB should be performed \\nin DCIS patients who have signs on palpation (tumor mass) or a large area of DCIS \\n(calcified areas >2–3\\xa0cm) [4]. SLNB is also recommended for patients planning to \\nundergo mastectomy [10].\\n Multicentric and\\xa0Multifocal Breast Cancer\\nIn multifocal and multicentric breast cancer cases, SLNB can be safely performed. \\nHowever, an increase in the false-negative rate has been reported in some studies. \\nPerforming the procedure using a radioactive substance may increase the accuracy \\nof SLN [11–14].\\n SLNB for\\xa0Patients with\\xa0Previous Axillary and\\xa0Breast Surgery\\nStudies have demonstrated that SLNs can be detected if superficial and deep lym-\\nphatic channels are not disrupted via excisional biopsy (particularly together with a \\nlarge skin incision at the upper-lateral quadrant and if the deep pectoral fascia is not \\naffected). However, in patients who have undergone breast-c onserving surgery \\n(BCS) and radiotherapy or have undergone ALND, lymphatic flow to the internal \\nmammary glands and contralateral axilla is observed, and these areas are considered \\nthe second region for SLNs. The detection of axillary SLNs for the second time in \\npatients who previously underwent SLNB is possible [15–18]. SLNB can be per-\\nformed after aesthetic interventions and even mastectomy [19–21]. Using tandem \\nmethods (blue dye lymphoscintigraphy) during SLNB in patients with previous \\noperations increases the success rate [15].\\n Male Breast Cancer\\nBreast cancer in males is rare and constitutes 1% of all breast cancer cases. SLNB \\nshould be performed in clinically node-negative male breast cancer to avoid unnec-\\nessary ALND.\\xa0SLNB has the same identification and false-negative rates in males \\nas in females [22–24].\\n340 M. Muslumanoglu\\n Elderly and\\xa0Overweight Patients\\nAlthough studies report high success rates of SLN detection in elderly and over-\\nweight patients, we have observed that this patient group is more problematic in \\npractice; it is particularly difficult to detect SLNs using blue dye alone. The utiliza-\\ntion of lymphoscintigraphy along with blue dye in elderly and overweight patients \\nincreases the success rate.\\n Axillary Staging in\\xa0Patients Treated with\\xa0Neoadjuvant Chemotherapy\\nThe axilla is clinically negative in approximately 40–50% of patients who are \\nplanned to receive neoadjuvant chemotherapy. In cases with a positive axillary \\nnode, axillary downstaging occurs at a rate of 30–40% with treatment [25–27]. \\nResearch to identify an approach that avoids unnecessary ALND in these two \\npatient groups is ongoing, and the method and timing of axillary staging remain \\ncontroversial. In clinically axilla-negative cases, SLNB can be performed prior \\nto neoadjuvant chemotherapy, and the need for ALND can be determined after \\ntreatment [25].\\nThe opinion that alterations of the breast and lymphatic channels due to chemo-\\ntherapeutic agents decrease the success rate of SLNB performed after chemother-\\napy and increase the false-negative rate has essentially been abandoned. In the \\nNSABP-B27 trial, the SLN detection rate after neoadjuvant chemotherapy was \\n84.8%, and the false-negative rate was 10.6% [28]. Recent trials have shown that the \\nuse of radiocolloid alone or together with blue dye significantly enhances accuracy \\nand that SLNB is possible after neoadjuvant chemotherapy [29, 30, 28]. ALND \\nshould be performed whenever the SLN cannot be detected.\\n SLNB Technique\\n Utilization of\\xa0Radiocolloid and\\xa0Lymphoscintigraphy\\nLymphoscintigraphy is based on the detection of lymph nodes following drainage \\nof the injected radiopharmaceutical agent to the regional lymph nodes via the lym-\\nphatic current. Regional lymphatic tracts are mapped using this method and whether \\nan SLN is identified as axillary or extra-axillary using preoperative imaging tech-\\nniques; during the operation, the SLN is detected by a gamma probe [31].\\nThe most frequently used radiopharmaceuticals are 99mTc-sulfur colloid, \\n99mTc-nanocolloid, and 99mTc-antimony trisulfide colloid.\\nTechnique During the operation, the tumor mass, including the primary site of \\ninjection, is excised first to perform the count correctly and minimize background \\nactivity. While the gamma probe is scanned over the skin of the axilla, the site \\nproducing the highest activity count is determined, and a small incision is made to \\n14 Evaluation of\\xa0Axillary Nodes 341\\nenter the axilla. The gamma probe is inserted through the incision, and the lymph \\nnode yielding the highest activity count is excised together with its surrounding \\nfat tissue by fine dissection. The activity count of the excised tissue is assessed in \\na separate location, and after confirming that it is the SLN, the axilla is reevalu-\\nated using the probe. If there are any remaining sites producing high activity \\ncounts, other SLNs are excised until the activity count is less than 10% of that of \\nthe initial node.\\n Vital Stain\\nBlue dye injection is another method for visualizing the SLN.\\xa0The vital stains used \\nfor this purpose include patent blue V, isosulfan blue (1% lymphazurin), and methy-\\nlene blue. Isosulfan blue is the most frequently used agent; however, following \\ninjection, reactions ranging from a simple rash to serious anaphylaxis are observed \\nwith an incidence ratio of 1:1.1% [32, 33]. Methylene blue is a less expensive alter-\\nnative that does not bind to plasma proteins and causes fewer anaphylactic reac-\\ntions. However, methylene blue can cause skin necrosis when intradermally \\nadministered, and a dilution ratio of 1:2 is recommended [34]. Studies have yielded \\nsimilar mapping results using both dyes.\\nTechnique During the operation, approximately 2–5\\xa0ml of blue dye is injected \\nby the subareolar routes, and the area is massaged toward the axilla for 2–5\\xa0min. \\nThen, the axilla is entered using a 2- to 3-cm transverse incision 2–3 cm below \\nthe axillary hairline. After opening the clavipectoral fascia, the lateral thoracic \\nvein, which extends toward the tail of the breast, is identified. The SLN is gener-\\nally located where the intercostal nerve crosses this region (axilla, level 1). The \\nblue-stained tract is identified via dissection. When traced either to the axilla or \\nto the breast, a blue-stained lymph node or nodes can be observed. The blue-\\nstained lymph node is removed together with the surrounding thin fat tissue. \\nThe results obtained with blue dye are similar to those obtained using radioac-\\ntive substances [35].\\n Combination of\\xa0Vital Stains and\\xa0Radioisotopic Methods\\nMany studies have reported that blue staining and radiocolloid use are complemen-\\ntary methods that enable the detection of additional SLNs when used together. \\nMoreover, the addition of blue dye to the radiocolloid prevents unnecessary dissec-\\ntions. The SLN detection rate is 95–98% using the radioisotope method [35, 36] and \\nis improved to 95–100% using the combined method. Both methods have high suc-\\ncess rates when performed alone, but combined methods should be used in select \\ncases (elderly, overweight, patients who are undergoing SLNB for the second time). \\nWe use blue dye (isosulfan blue) in routine practice in our clinic. Lymphoscintigraphy \\nhas the advantage of showing extra axillary drainage [19].\\n342 M. Muslumanoglu\\n Determining the\\xa0Site of\\xa0Injection\\nStudies suggest that SLN detection is more successful via the intradermal or sub-\\nareolar/periareolar routes; however, most studies indicate that the location of injec-\\ntion does not have an effect on SLN detection [35–39]. Each clinic should perform \\nthe technique that they have found successful. We prefer subareolar injections.\\n Number of\\xa0SLNs\\nFrequently, one SLN is removed from the axilla. The false-negative rate drops to 1% \\nwhen three or more SLNs are removed. However, no benefit is observed when more \\nthan four to five SLNs are removed [40, 41]. When more than one blue ganglion is \\ndetected, removing all of the lymph nodes decreases the false-negative rate.\\n Behavior of\\xa0Micrometastases\\nDetailed SLN examination (multiple sections with several ganglia) has enabled the \\ndetection of smaller metastases. Metastases smaller than 0.2\\xa0 mm are defined as \\nsubmicro-isolated tumor cells, metastases that are 0.2–2\\xa0mm in size are classified \\nas micrometastases, and those >2\\xa0mm are macrometastases. When isolated tumor \\ncells are detected, the axilla is considered negative. When micrometastasis is \\ndetected in SLNs, the rate of metastasis in non-SLNs is 10–40%. In macrometasta-\\nsis, this rate is even higher. Patients with micrometastases in SLNs who did not \\nundergo ALND in BCS and who received radiation therapy were investigated in a \\nrandomized trial in Z0011 [42]. This trial followed 446 patients who underwent \\nSLNB and 445 patients who underwent SLNB\\xa0+\\xa0ALND.\\xa0The proportion of patients \\nwho had three or more positive LNs was 5% in the SLNB group and 17.6% in the \\nSLNB\\xa0+\\xa0ALND group (p\\xa0<\\xa00.001). After an average follow-up of 9.3\\xa0years, the \\n10-year DFS was 80.2% in the SLNB-alone group and 78.2% in the ALND group. \\nThe OS rate was 86.3% in the SLNB-alone group and 83.6% in the ALND group. \\nAt 5\\xa0years, 1 nodal recurrence was observed in the SLNB-alone group vs none in \\nthe ALND group. Ten-year regional recurrence did not differ significantly between \\nthe two groups [42]. According to this study, which was terminated due to difficul-\\nties in patient accrual and low recurrence rates, there was no benefit for the patients \\nin the ALND group.\\nThe detection of minimal disease (micrometastasis) in SLNs may be sufficient to \\ninitiate adjuvant therapy. In all valid protocols used today, these patients receive \\nadjuvant therapy similar to that used in axilla+ disease (N1a). Therefore, treatment \\nfor these patients is not incomplete.\\nThe only difficulty in treating micrometastatic disease is determining the irradia-\\ntion area for axillary and peripheral lymphatics. The number of involved axillary \\n14 Evaluation of\\xa0Axillary Nodes 343\\nlymph nodes is a critical component of this decision. Given the availability of effec-\\ntive adjuvant treatment options and the very low axillary recurrence rates (as in \\nALND), conservative decisions are now made on behalf of the patient when select-\\ning a radiotherapy area; irradiating wide areas, as is done in Nx, appears to be \\novertreatment.\\n Internal Mammary Lymph Node Biopsy (IMLNB)\\nA small percentage (10%) of lymphatics drain into the IMLNs, particularly in cen-\\ntrally and medially located tumors. IMLNB may alter the treatment plan in 0.1% of \\nbreast cancer patients and thus is regarded as unnecessary. However, according to \\nthe new staging system, only IMLN positivity is classified as N1c; therefore, \\nIMLNB could change the stage for this group of patients. IMLN detection and sam-\\npling are necessary to make a decision regarding the adjuvant treatment policy in \\naxilla-negative patients and to determine if IMLNs will be irradiated. For this rea-\\nson, we recommend performing IMLNB when the axilla is negative in centrally or \\nmedially located tumors.\\nThe only method demonstrating lymphatic drainage to this region is lymphoscin-\\ntigraphy with the utilization of gamma probes. Usually, the second to third intercos-\\ntal space is explored in selected axilla-negative cases.\\n Locally Advanced Breast Cancer\\nIn locally advanced breast cancer (LABC), the utilization of axilla-effective sys-\\ntemic treatment modalities (taxane, trastuzumab, etc.) in routine practice has led to \\nincreases in complete response rates (breast\\xa0+\\xa0axilla) from approximately 10% to \\n39–70%; for some specific patient groups (ER negative, PR negative, HER2 posi-\\ntive), higher rates of complete response have been achieved. ALND following che-\\nmotherapy was the standard axillary approach for LABC, but SLNB is now \\nrecommended in patients with axilla positive prior to chemotherapy to obtain a \\ncomplete clinical response after chemotherapy. According to the results of prospec-\\ntive randomized trials, if two to three lymph nodes are removed using both blue dye \\nand lymphoscintigraphy, the false-negative rate is 14%, and the detection rate is \\n98% [25–27, 42, 43].\\nIn cases with a positive axillary node, axillary downstaging occurs at a rate of \\n30–40% with treatment, and this rate is even higher in triple-negative and Her2- \\npositive patients (Table\\xa014.1) [25–27, 44]. The identification rate of SLNB may \\ndecrease in patients whose axilla become clinically negative after neoadjuvant \\ntherapy, and the false-negative rate may increase depending on case selection. \\nThe\\xa0biology of the cancer is also an important factor predicting the response rate. \\n344 M.

Intraoperative \\nevaluation of the SLN in clinical axilla-negative patients lost its importance follow-\\ning the Z0011 trial based on the equivalent long-term results of ALND versus radia-\\ntion therapy in axilla 1–2 micro/macro-positive SLNs [42].\\n False Negativity\\nFalse negativity is defined as the detection of negative SLNs when axillary metasta-\\nsis is indeed present. SLNs should be detected in at least 85% of patients using the \\nmethod of choice, and the false-negative rate should be less than 5% [11]. Use of the \\nblue dye and radiocolloid techniques in combination is recommended for surgeons \\nin training to allow them to become familiar with the anatomy and decrease false- \\nnegative results.\\n346 M. Muslumanoglu\\n Axillary Lymph Node Dissection\\n Indications\\nALND was once routinely practiced in breast cancer cases, but the indications for \\nALND have been revised as SLNB has become standard in early-stage (stage I, II) \\nclinically N0 cases. Today, ALND is performed in clinical N+ early-stage breast \\ncancer and N+ LABC post CT.\\xa0General attitudes about early-stage N+ breast cancer \\nhave changed. Neoadjuvant CT is advised to achieve complete pathologic response \\nto perform SLNB to preserve the axilla. ALND should also be performed when \\nSLN cannot be detected.\\n Anatomy of\\xa0the\\xa0Axilla\\nLymph node groups are categorized into three levels according to their orientation \\nto the minor pectoral muscle for the surgeon’s convenience. Level 1 contains the \\nlateral border of the minor pectoral muscle. The central and interpectoral groups, \\nwhich are located between the medial and lateral borders of the minor pectoral \\nmuscle, form level 2. The subclavicular group, which is located medially or superi-\\norly to the upper border of the minor pectoral muscle, is categorized as level 3.\\n Axillary Structure\\nThe intercostal brachial and intercostal thoracic nerves are sensory nerves; they \\ninnervate the skin at the medial part of the upper arm and the posterior part of the \\naxilla. Injury will result in sensory loss at the corresponding skin area.\\nThe long thoracic nerve, which innervates the serratus anterior muscle, origi-\\nnates from C5 to C7, extends inferiorly over the thoracic wall, and branches at the \\nlevel of the fourth to fifth intercostal. Its injury causes a winged scapula defect.\\nThe thoracodorsal nerve, which innervates the latissimus dorsi, originates from \\nC6 to C8. Preservation of this nerve during dissection is important for subsequent \\nreconstructive interventions.\\nThe Rotter ganglia are in contact with the lateral pectoral pedicle, which is \\nlocated posteriorly to the major pectoral muscle.\\nThe lateral pectoral nerve, which is located in this pedicle, innervates the medial \\npart of the major pectoral muscle. Its injury results in atrophy of the major pectoral \\nmuscle.\\nThe medial pectoral is located anteriorly to the minor pectoral muscle at a dis-\\ntance of 1–2\\xa0cm, and the lateral nerve is located more laterally. It originates from the \\nmedial chord of the brachial plexus (C8–T1). Its injury results in the atrophy of both \\nmuscles.\\n14 Evaluation of\\xa0Axillary Nodes 347\\nAtrophy of the pectoral muscles does not cause problems at the early stage but \\nresults in cosmetic issues at the chest wall in the long term.\\n ALND Technique\\nIt is now known that extended lymphatic resection does not provide any benefit for \\npatient survival. Therefore, in routine ALND, only level 1 and level 2 lymph nodes \\nare removed. When lymph nodes are confirmed as positive by preoperative exami-\\nnations or detected intraoperatively via palpation, level 3 lymph nodes are also \\nincluded in the dissection. With efficient extraction, level 3 lymph nodes can be \\nremoved without sacrificing the minor pectoral muscle.\\nThe incision should be made below the hairline to permit subsequent epilation \\nand should not continue beyond the pectoral muscle anteriorly and the latissimus \\ndorsi muscle posteriorly. Oblique transverse incisions, U-shaped incisions with the \\ngap facing up, and reverse S incisions provide good exposure.\\nWhen started medially, the major pectoral muscle is elevated with a retractor. \\nAnterior to the minor pectoral muscle below, the medial pectoral pedicle can be \\nobserved 1–2\\xa0cm medial of its border. This pedicle should be preserved to avoid \\natrophy of the major pectoral muscle.\\nThe lateral border of the minor pectoral muscle is freed from the chest wall. This \\nincision is extended upward until the axillary vein is exposed. In most cases, inter-\\ncostal brachial nerves are sacrificed; however, with fine dissection at T2 and T3 \\nabove, the nerves can be separated from the axillary tissue and preserved.\\nThen, the long thoracic nerve is again identified over the serratus anterior muscle \\nbut located deeper (more posterior) than these sensory nerves. At the level of the \\nthird intercostal nerve below, it can be found by caressing the serratus anterior mus-\\ncle with an index finger. It is located inside the fascia of the muscle and should \\nalways be preserved. After its exposure, the axillary tissue is dissected laterally \\nfrom the chest wall. By retracting the major pectoral muscle, palpable lymph nodes \\nare identified in the interpectoral region (Rotter ganglion). The few lymph nodes \\nfound here are removed without damaging the lateral pectoral pedicle, which \\nextends anteriorly toward the major pectoral muscle.\\nThere is no need to resect the minor pectoral muscle for a level 3 dissection. For \\na level 2 dissection, the surgeon should begin from the highest point posterior to the \\nminor pectoral muscle. The surgeon should not extend the incision above the axillary \\nvein; resection of the overlying fatty tissue increases the risk for lymphedema. Below \\nthe axillary vein, fatty tissue is skimmed off inferiorly from the chest wall. The dis-\\nsection is continued inferiorly and laterally, and small branches emanating from the \\naxillary vein are ligated. The lateral thoracic vein (thoracoepigastric vein), which \\noriginates from the direction of the axillary vein and enters the axillary tissue, is \\nligated. The thoracodorsal vein originates distally and posteriorly to the axillary vein \\nand laterally to the lateral thoracic vein. The thoracodorsal nerve occasionally enters \\nmore medially, extends more deeply, and distally joins the thoracodorsal vessels. \\n348 M. Muslumanoglu\\nThe thoracodorsal nerve can also be observed as a single pedicle adhered to the tho-\\nracodorsal vessels. However, it always enters the latissimus dorsi muscle from the \\nmedial side.\\nFatty tissue between the long thoracic nerve and the thoracodorsal pedicle is \\nskimmed off inferiorly from the axillary vein, and the subscapular muscle is exposed \\nbehind. Then, by placing an index finger on the long thoracic nerve, the nerve is \\ntraced until its entry site into the serratus anterior muscle (finger dissection). \\nLaterally, the thoracodorsal pedicle is traced until its entry site into the latissimus \\ndorsi muscle; the small venous branches are ligated, and the specimen is removed \\nduring this procedure.\\nWhile approaching the axilla laterally to medially, the latissimus dorsi muscle is \\ntraced upward from its border; at the site where it becomes tendinous, the axillary \\nvein is exposed. Dissection should be continued below to where the latissimus dorsi \\nmuscle joins the serratus anterior muscle. Following removal of the tissue, a suction \\ndrain is placed in the axillary cavity near the incision.\\n Complications of\\xa0ALND\\nSLNB is now the method of choice to avoid short- and long-term morbidities caused \\nby ALND.\\xa0Unfortunately, ALND must still be performed in many cases.\\n Neurovascular Injury\\nThe long thoracic nerve: Injury of this nerve is caused by cutting, traction, or ther-\\nmal damage; however, it is damaged in less than 1% of cases. Winged scapula defect \\ncaused by its injury results in cosmetic problems.\\nThe thoracodorsal nerve: Because this does not cause a significant neurological \\ndeficit, this nerve can be excised to obtain a clean axilla if it is invaded by metastatic \\nlymph nodes.\\nThe intercostal brachial nerve: This nerve transverses the axilla and is generally \\ncut during ALND, causing paresthesia at the medial half of the upper arm and \\nadversely affecting quality of life in women.\\nInjury to the medial pectoral nerve does not cause short-term problems but \\nresults in cosmetic problems due to atrophy of the major pectoral muscle.\\nThe brachial plexus is located superior to the axillary vein; thus, there is no risk \\nof injury as long as one does not extend the dissection above the axillary vein.\\n Seroma\\nSeroma forms in nearly all cases to some extent and is thus not considered a surgical \\ncomplication. However, prolonged seroma increases the risk of infection and delays \\n14 Evaluation of\\xa0Axillary Nodes 349\\nadjuvant treatment. A low-pressure suction drain is placed during the operation to \\ninhibit seroma formation. Because prolonged seroma following removal of the \\ndrain is a source of infection, it should be emptied via percutaneous aspiration. One \\neffective method is delaying exercise and complete shoulder movements until after \\nthe fifth day following the operation. However, some arm and shoulder exercises \\nshould be started in the early stage to prevent shoulder problems due to a limited \\nrange of movement.\\n Chronic Pain and\\xa0Limited Range of\\xa0Movement\\nMore than 50% of women experience neuropathic pain, which is sometimes severe \\nand interferes with sleep; this pain increases with movement; is localized to the \\nchest wall, axilla, arm, and shoulder regions; and can continue after the third month \\npostoperatively. These pains are thought to be due to nerve injury and to the addition \\nof radiotherapy and/or chemotherapy to treatment [45]. Patients who experience \\nmore pain with movement generally limit their shoulder movements, leading to \\nfrozen shoulder syndrome. Starting arm movements at the early period postopera-\\ntively with the aid of adequate analgesia prevents these complications.\\n Lymphedema\\nLymphatic fluid, which originates in small lymphatic channels, first drains into \\nregional lymph nodes; it is then carried to the systemic circulation via efferent lym-\\nphatic channels and the main lymphatic duct. Any obstruction in these channels \\nresults in the development of lymphedema in the tissue that could not be drained. \\nIrradiation of the peripheral lymphatics is another factor that increases lymph-\\nedema. Recurrent attacks of lymphangitis and cellulitis also increase the risk for \\nlymphedema in the arm. Lymphedema of up to 1–2\\xa0cm is considered mild and is \\nobserved in 20–30% of patients with level 1–2 ALND.\\xa0Larger swelling is consid-\\nered a serious lymphedema and is observed in less than 5% of patients. The risk of \\nlymphedema in patients with level 3 ALND is 30%, and therefore level 3 ALND is \\nnot performed without a valid reason. Mild lymphedema can be observed in 5% of \\npatients following SLNB.\\xa0The aims are to educate patients and prevent lymphedema \\nbefore it develops. Patients who have undergone ALND should be advised not to \\nstrain the affected arm, not to suspend the arm while working, and to avoid proce-\\ndures that could increase the risk of lymphangitis (skin injury due to manicure, etc.); \\npatients are also recommended not to gain weight.\\nWhen lymphedema develops, its severity is first assessed as follows:\\nStage 0: There is only dullness in the arm.\\nStage 1: There is pitting edema (recoverable stage because there is no fibrosis).\\nStage 2: The arm is stretched, and there is fibrosis.\\nStage 3: Elephantiasis is present, with skin signs such as fibrosis, sclerosis, and \\nkeratosis.\\n350 M. Muslumanoglu\\n Treatment and\\xa0Prevention\\nRegular trunk cleaning and massage, which is called manual lymphatic drainage, \\nare applied to patients by trained physiotherapists, and bandaging is applied. If no \\nresponse is obtained using these procedures and if fibrosis has begun in the arm, \\nlaser therapy (low-level laser therapy) can be attempted. Laser therapy resolves \\nfibrotic scar tissue by acting on fibroblasts and stimulates lymphatic drainage. \\nThis method was demonstrated to have a lymphedema-reducing effect in 52% of \\ncases [45, 46].\\nThe detection and preservation of lymphatics of the arm in the axilla using the \\ninjection of blue dye into the upper arm is called reverse axillary mapping. Research \\non this subject is ongoing [45].\\n Conclusion\\nSLNB is equivalent to ALND in clinically node-negative patients in terms of stag-\\ning, accuracy, DFS, and OS.\\xa0 ALND has been considered mandatory in sentinel \\nnode-positive patients, but recent data with 10\\xa0years of follow-up have demonstrated \\nthat BCS and radiotherapy are equivalent to ALND of micro/macro-metastatic \\nSLNs. This approach will reduce the morbidity of dissection without decreasing \\nOS.\\xa0SLNB is also beginning to be used in LABC patients treated with neo-adjuvant \\nchemotherapy. In these cases, axilla can be saved, as in early breast cancer. With \\nneo-adjuvant CT, axillary dissection can be avoided in up to half of patients. ALND \\nshould be performed whenever the SLN cannot be detected.\\nReferences\\n 1. Filippakis GM, Zografos G.\\xa0Contraindications of sentinel lymph node biopsy: are there any \\nreally?

Fortunately, the outcomes of patients with early breast cancer have \\nimproved with the use of adjuvant systemic treatments [1]. Long-term follow-up \\nfrom the Oxford overview demonstrated absolute benefit from chemotherapy, \\nregardless of age and estrogen receptor (ER) status [2]. However, breast cancer is a \\nheterogeneous disease that is composed of several biological subtypes with distinct \\nbehaviors and responses to therapy. Consequently, chemotherapy does not offer the \\nsame magnitude of benefit for all breast cancer subtypes. Thus far, clinicopathologi-\\ncal parameters have guided decisions for adjuvant systemic chemotherapy, but \\nrecently genomic tests have been integrated, especially for the intermediate-risk \\ngroup. However, the selection of patients, timing, and dosing and the scheduling of \\nthe optimal chemotherapy regimen for the appropriate patient may be challenging. \\nThis chapter evaluates the evolution and recent advances in adjuvant systemic che-\\nmotherapy for human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-negative breast \\ncancer (Figs.\\xa015.1, 15.2, 15.3, 15.4, and 15.5).\\nL.

The situations in which multigene tests \\nmay be particularly helpful can be summarized as follows: tumor size between 1 and 3\\xa0cm and ER/PR \\npositive and HER2 negative and node negative or Nmi and Grade 2 and Ki-67 between 15% and 35%. \\nIn hormone receptor-positive T1c N0 (1–2\\xa0cm) tumors, grade 3 disease with a high Ki-67 value (e.g., \\nabove 35%) and PgR <20% may be considered adequate for chemotherapy indication.

Standard pathological features may not be sufficient to avoid overtreat-\\nment, especially for luminal breast cancer patients with weaker ER expression and \\nintermediate proliferation scores. In such situations, the absolute benefit expected \\nfrom systemic adjuvant cytotoxic therapies could be estimated by either sophisti-\\ncated gene expression assays or more historical clinical tools such as Adjuvant! \\nOnline (www.adjuvantonline.com) and some immunohistochemical tests.\\n Tumor Size\\nFor patients with node-negative breast cancer, tumor size is a known independent \\nprognostic factor [3]. Pathological tumor size (>2\\xa0cm) is associated with both dis-\\ntant disease-free survival (hazard ratio [HR] for recurrence 1.61, 95% CI 1.14–2.25) \\nand overall survival (HR for mortality 1.68, 95% CI 1.12–2.52) [4].

The choice of \\ntreatment depends on disease, co-morbidities, life expectancy and patient preferences. In patients \\nover 70\\xa0 years of age, treatment should be individualized. A meta-analysis showed that dose- \\nintensive treatment increased overall survival in hormone receptor-negative and hormone receptor- \\npositive patients (EBTCG, San Antonio BCS, 2017). bIn patients with Luminal A-like tumors and \\n1–3 positive lymph nodes (with the evaluation of other factors such as grade, age, or multigene \\nsignature test results), “adjuvant endocrine therapy alone” may be an option. cFactors that are rela-\\ntive indications for the inclusion of adjuvant cytotoxic chemotherapy include the following: histo-\\nlogical grade 3 tumor, 4 or more positive nodes, high Ki67, extensive lymphovascular invasion, and \\nlow hormone receptor staining. dThe Luminal A phenotype is less responsive to chemotherapy. In \\nnode-negative disease, chemotherapy should not be added based on the T size. A combination of \\nthe biological properties of the tumor (such as Ki67, LVI, grade, and multigene signature) must be \\nused to assess whether to provide chemotherapy. Chemotherapy should be added in high-risk \\npatients based on the involvement of 4 or more lymph nodes. eBased on immunohistochemistry \\n(IHC), in Luminal B-like (HER2-negative) tumors, chemotherapy may be omitted in some low-r isk \\npatients (based on combinations of certain prognostic factors such as low tumor mass, low grade, \\nlow Ki67, an absence of LVI, and older age). fBased on multigene signature tests, chemotherapy \\nmay be omitted for patients with Luminal B-like (HER2-negative) disease with a low Oncotype \\nDx® score, MammaPrint® low-risk status, low PAM50 ROR score or EndoPredict® low-r isk status. \\nMammaPrint can be used in node-positive patients. In the TAILORx ClinicalTrial (ASCO Congress \\n2018), adjuvant endocrine therapy and chemoendocrine therapy had similar efficacy in women \\nwith hormone-receptor-positive, HER2-negative, axillary node-negative breast cancer who had a \\n15 Adjuvant Chemotherapy for\\xa0HER2-Negative Early-Stage Breast Cancer 361\\nIBC: HR-NEGATIVE – HER2-NEGATIVE DISEASE(a-c)\\n(Ductal, Lobular, Mixed, Metaplastic histology)\\npT0-1- N1mi pT2-T3 and pN0-N1mi pT0-T3; and Node positive \\n(£ 2 mm axillary node (presence of > 2 mm \\nmetastasis) metastasis to 1 or more \\nipsilateral axillary lymph \\nnode)\\nTm ≤ 1.0 cm Tm = 1.1-2 cm \\nAdjuvant Adjuvant Adjuvant \\nchemotherapy chemotherapy \\nchemotherapy \\n(proposal 1) (proposal 1) Adjuvant \\nchemotherapy \\n(proposal 1) \\nFig. 15.4 Adjuvant systemic therapy for stage IB, II, IIIA (T3N1M0)—hormone receptor- negative \\nand HER2-negative disease. aThere is no absolute age limit. Rather, treatment depends on the dis-\\nease, the presence of comorbidities, the patient’s life expectancy, and patient preferences. For \\npatients >70\\xa0years of age, treatment should be individualized. Regardless of the size of the invasive \\ntumor, adjuvant chemotherapy may be recommended in the presence of N1mi. bFertility preserva-\\ntion (e.g., by ovarian tissue or oocyte conservation) should be offered to women <40\\xa0years of age. \\nOvarian function suppression with LHRHa during chemotherapy should be offered for receptor- \\nnegative disease. cIn triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC), the regimen should include anthracy-\\nclines and taxanes. Although the data are insufficient, a platinum-based regimen may be considered \\nonly when a BRCA mutation has been identified. Anthracyclines followed by taxanes represent an \\nacceptable regimen for BRCA-mutant TNBC.\\xa0Dose-dense chemotherapy requiring growth factor \\nsupport may also be an option. The preference of dose-intensive treatment in these patients was not \\nrecommended in St. Gallen 2017 (37% yes, 55% no). However, a meta-analysis showed that dose- \\nintensive treatment improved overall survival in hormone receptor-negative and hormone receptor- \\npositive patients (EBTCG, San Antonio BCS, 2017). Neoadjuvant treatment should be considered \\nin triple-negative patients with stage II and III disease. Treatment with platinum or alkylating \\nagents may be considered in neoadjuvant chemotherapy (71% yes, 15% no). Provision of platinum- \\nbased treatment for all patients was voted as 10% ‘yes’ and 86% ‘no’ at St Gallen 2017. A platinum- \\nbased regimen may be recommended, particularly when a BRCA mutation is detected (voted as \\n47% ‘yes’ and 43% ‘no’ at St Gallen 2017).

However, the chemotherapy benefit for invasive disease-free \\nsurvival varied with the combination of recurrence score and age (P\\xa0=\\xa00.004), with some benefit of \\nchemotherapy found in women 50\\xa0 years of age or younger with a recurrence score of 16–25. \\nMammaPrint (Agendia, Irvine, CA): In patients with 1–3 positive lymph nodes, tests can be per-\\nformed to avoid adjuvant chemotherapy if the patient is at high clinical risk group in the MINDACT \\ncategorization (however, the patient should be informed that there may be an additional benefit of \\nchemotherapy with multiple LN positivity). gFor Luminal B-like (HER2-n egative) tumors, the regi-\\nmen, if given, should contain anthracyclines and taxanes. A high-risk group might exist for which \\ndose-dense therapy with G-CSF may also be preferred. hConsider adjuvant bisphosphonate therapy \\nin postmenopausal (natural or induced) patients receiving adjuvant therapy\\n362 L.

Clearly, triple-negative tumors have a \\nworse prognosis compared to their ER-positive counterparts, even with a very small \\ntumor size. This worse prognosis was supported by a study involving 421 breast \\ncancer patients with <T1b tumors, of which 29 (7%) were triple negative [5]. The \\nrecurrence rate was 11.1, and 7 percent among triple-negative, ER-positive and \\nHER2- positive patients, respectively. Thus, tumor size is not always an unfavorable \\nrisk factor; HER2-positive and triple-negative tumors have a higher recurrence rate \\ndespite a small tumor size, as expected.\\n Nodal Involvement\\nThe rate of breast cancer recurrence is higher in patients with pathologically \\ninvolved lymph nodes. The presence of isolated tumor cells is also defined as node- \\nnegative disease but is clinically insignificant. However, micrometastases carry a \\nmodest negative impact on breast outcomes and are treated as pathologically node- \\npositive breast cancer. Compared to patients with disease confined to the breast \\nonly, those with disease spread to the lymph nodes have a lower rate of survival at \\n5\\xa0years (84% versus 99%, respectively) [6]. However, for luminal disease, one to \\nthree positive nodes is not a clear indication for adjuvant chemotherapy, especially \\nin the setting of strong hormone receptor expression, low grade and low prolifera-\\ntion markers such as Ki67.\\n15 Adjuvant Chemotherapy for\\xa0HER2-Negative Early-Stage Breast Cancer 363\\n Tumor-Infiltrating Lymphocytes\\nImmune system activation has clear effects on the survival of breast cancer patients. \\nPreviously, lymphocytic infiltration was linked to high proliferation, and the pres-\\nence of tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) was associated with improved patho-\\nlogical response rates, disease-free survival (DFS) and overall survival (OS) for \\ntriple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) and HER2-positive breast cancer subtypes [7, \\n8]. The combined analysis of TNBC patients included in the ECOG 2197 and \\nECOG 1199 trials confirmed the independent prognostic value of TILs for DFS, OS \\nand distant recurrence-free survival [9].\\n Intrinsic Subtypes and\\xa0Genomic Tests\\nGene-profiling techniques have confirmed biological heterogeneity for breast can-\\ncer with at least 6 major subtypes: luminal A and luminal B; HER2-enriched; basal- \\nlike; normal breast-like; and the claudin-low or mesenchymal-like subtype [10, 11]. \\nUncertainty about the optimal treatment usually arises in the case of the luminal \\nsubtype. Luminal A tumors are characterized by the expression of estrogen- \\nregulated genes, transcription factors and luminal cytokeratins, whereas luminal B \\ntumors are characterized by a higher genomic grade, lower ER levels, and varying \\ndegrees of HER2 gene cluster expression [11, 12]. ‘Luminal A-like’ disease is the \\npreferred clinicopathological surrogate for the Luminal A subtype, which is \\ndescribed as ER and PgR positive, HER2-negative, and low Ki67.\\nKi67 is a marker of proliferation that is expressed exclusively during active \\nphases of the cell cycle [13]. It is commonly assessed by immunohistochemistry \\n(IHC) in clinical settings and has been correlated with survival [14]. Ki67 scoring \\nis moderately reproducible when manual scoring methods are used, and there is \\n currently no consensus on the optimal Ki67 cut-off point for either molecular \\nsubtyping or the prediction of prognosis [15]. The 2013 St Gallen guidelines offer \\na level of <14% for the best correlation with the gene-expression definition of \\nLuminal A; however, with this cut-off point, a high rate (25%) of misclassifica-\\ntion was noted [16]. Due to the considerable disagreement at St Gallen 2013 \\nabout the optimal Ki67 cut-off, it was revised up to 20%. However, more recent \\nguidelines suggest that Ki67 scores should be evaluated according to local insti-\\ntutional values [17]. If the median Ki67 score in receptor-positive disease for a \\ngiven laboratory is 20%, values of 30% or above could be considered high and \\nthose of 10% or less as low. An international study has proposed that after cali-\\nbrating to a common scoring method via a web-based tool, laboratories can \\nachieve high inter-laboratory reproducibility in Ki67 scoring on centrally stained \\ntissue microarray slides [18]. However, the lack of standardization of preanalyti-\\ncal and analytical features for IHC limits the utility of this method for clinical \\ndecision-making.\\n364 L. Ozer and A. Aydiner\\nThe level of progesterone receptor expression is also utilized to discriminate the \\n‘Luminal A-like’ and ‘Luminal B-like’ subtypes. Prat et\\xa0al. [19] offered a cut-off of \\n≥20% as best corresponding to the Luminal A subtype. Lower or absent PgR cor-\\nrelates with Luminal B disease and poorer outcomes but may not add to Ki67\\xa0in \\ndifferentiating Luminal A from B [20].\\nWhen adequate reproducibility is not achieved with either IHC technique, \\ngene expression signatures may be preferred to identify low-risk patients who \\ncan be spared from chemotherapy. Multiparameter molecular tests such as \\nPAM50 or MammaPrint/BluePrint can be used to determine the intrinsic sub-\\ntypes [21, 22]. The PAM50 test, which is based on a qRT-PCR assay, classifies \\nER-positive and ER-negative breast cancer patients into subtypes that can pre-\\ndict outcomes [23, 24]. It measures the expression of 50 classifier genes and 5 \\ncontrol genes, categorizes tumors into the 4 intrinsic subtypes (luminal A, lumi-\\nnal B, HER2-enriched, and basal-like), and provides a risk of recurrence (ROR) \\nscore to estimate the probability of relapse at 5\\xa0years. The MammaPrint assay is \\na 70-gene signature test that classifies tumors into groups that are associated \\nwith good or poor prognosis on the basis of the risk of distant recurrence at 5 and \\n10\\xa0years [25]. A prospective, randomized phase III study (MINDACT) evaluated \\nwhether patients with high-risk clinical features and a low-risk gene-expression \\nprofile could be spared from chemotherapy safely [26]. Avoidance of chemo-\\ntherapy on the basis of gene signature results led to a 5-year rate of distant \\nmetastasis-free survival (DMFS) (94.7%) that was 1.5% points lower than the \\nrate obtained with chemotherapy (95% confidence interval [CI] 92.5–96.2%), \\nthus achieving the primary objective of the study. The trial included both node-\\nnegative and node-positive patients, and similar rates of survival without distant \\nmetastasis were reported for both groups. An expert panel reviewed the results \\nof the MINDACT study and recommended the MammaPrint assay for use in \\npatients with one to three positive nodes and a high clinical risk (determined \\naccording to Adjuvant! Online) to inform decisions on withholding adjuvant sys-\\ntemic chemotherapy. However, patients, particularly those with more than one \\nmetastatic lymph node, should be informed that a benefit from chemotherapy \\ncannot be excluded [27].\\nOther multigene assays that may assist in discriminating Luminal B-like \\nbreast cancer patients who would potentially benefit from chemotherapy include \\nOncotype Dx® and Endopredict®. Oncotype Dx is a 21-gene expression assay \\nthat estimates the 10-year risk of distant recurrence in patients with hormone \\nreceptor-positive (HR+), HER2 (−) and axillary lymph node-negative disease. \\nThe results of the test are reported as a recurrence score (RS) ranging from 0 to \\n100, divided into low-risk (<18), intermediate-risk (18–30), and high-risk (≥31) \\ncategories. However, the prospective validation trial of OncotypeDx (TAILORx) \\nutilized different boundaries to minimize the potential for undertreatment of the \\nparticipants involved (clinicaltrials.gov). The low-risk group was defined as \\nthose with RS\\xa0≤\\xa010, the intermediate-r isk group as those with RS\\xa0=\\xa011–25, and \\nthe high-risk group as RS\\xa0 ≥\\xa0 26. For the low-risk population who received \\n15 Adjuvant Chemotherapy for\\xa0HER2-Negative Early-Stage Breast Cancer 365\\n endocrine therapy alone, the invasive disease-free survival (IDFS) rate was \\n93.8%, and the overall survival (OS) rate was 98% at 5\\xa0years [28]. Approximately \\n30% of this group included patients with tumor size ≥2\\xa0cm, and 66% had inter-\\nmediate or high histological grades and would otherwise be recommended to \\nreceive chemotherapy on the basis of clinicopathological features. The survival \\noutcomes of the intermediate-risk group, which constituted the majority (67%) \\nof the patients in this trial, had been reported in ASCO 2018 congress. In the \\nTAILORx ClinicalTrial, adjuvant endocrine therapy and chemoendocrine ther-\\napy had similar efficacy in women with hormone-receptor-positive, HER2-\\nnegative, axillary node-negative breast cancer who had a midrange 21-gene \\nrecurrence score RS\\xa0=\\xa011–25. However, the chemotherapy benefit for invasive \\ndisease-f ree survival varied with the combination of recurrence score and age \\n(P\\xa0=\\xa00.004), with some benefit of chemotherapy found in women 50\\xa0years of age \\nor younger with a recurrence score of 16–25. Retrospective single-institution \\nfollow-u p data from a similar set of patients with RS\\xa0=\\xa011–25 demonstrated a \\n5-year IDFS rate of 92.6%, which was comparable between those who received \\nchemotherapy and those who did not. However, a benefit of chemotherapy in the \\nintermediate-risk group cannot be ruled out based solely on the results of this \\nanalysis due to the small number of patients, short follow-up time, lack of events \\nand retrospective nature of the trial. The utility of OncotypeDx for node-positive \\npatients is not clear. The ongoing RxPONDER trial is currently evaluating the \\nbenefit of chemotherapy for patients with node-positive, HR-positive and HER2-\\nnegative disease with RS\\xa0≤\\xa025. The results of this study are supposed to guide \\ntreatment decisions for node-positive patients.\\nEndoPredict (EP) is another multigene assay including 8 genes associated with \\ntumor proliferation and hormone receptor activity and 4 reference genes but not ER, \\nPR and HER2 status. An EP score of 0–15 stratifies ER-positive, HER2-negative \\nbreast cancer patients into high- and low-risk groups. The assay was initially uti-\\nlized to estimate distant recurrence risk among luminal breast cancer patients treated \\nwith adjuvant endocrine therapy alone [29]. EPclin is a combined score of clinical \\nrisk factors (tumor size and nodal status) that was compared with purely clinical risk \\nclassifications and found to be strikingly superior to known prognosticators such as \\nSt. Gallen, German S3 and NCCN [30].\\nThe St Gallen 2017 guidelines recommend gene expression assays to guide the \\ndecision on adjuvant chemotherapy, mainly for patients with tumors between 1 and \\n3\\xa0cm, zero to two or three positive lymph nodes, and an intermediate proliferative \\nfraction. The Panel has not endorsed a specific multigene assay but has suggested \\nthat none of the tests should be the only factor considered in making a decision to \\nproceed with or avoid chemotherapy [31]. NCCN guidelines have additionally rec-\\nommended OncotypeDx for select patients with one to three involved lymph nodes \\nto guide chemotherapy decisions based on a retrospective analysis of a prospective \\nstudy (www.nccn.org. version 1.2018). According to the NCCN panel, other prog-\\nnostic multigene assays may be considered for prognostic purposes but not for pre-\\ndicting response to chemotherapy.\\n366 L. Ozer and A. Aydiner\\n Rare Histological Subtypes\\nMore than 90% of invasive breast carcinomas consist of infiltrating ductal, lobular \\nor mixed histological subtypes. The rest, including mucinous (colloid), tubular, \\nmedullary, papillary, adenoid cystic, micropapillary, apocrine and metaplastic breast \\ncancer, constitute less than 10% of cases [6]. Within these subtypes, tubular and \\nmucinous carcinomas are characterized by better prognosis compared with infiltrat-\\ning ductal carcinomas [32]. Thus, for tubular and mucinous cancers, the treatment \\ndecision is based on tumor size and ALN status. Since the majority of tubular cancer \\nis ER positive and HER2-negative, the accuracy of the ER and/or HER2 determina-\\ntion should be reviewed if a tubular breast cancer is ER negative and/or HER2- \\npositive. If a tubular or mucinous cancer is confirmed as ER negative, then the \\ntumor should be treated according to the guidelines for usual histology, ER-negative \\nbreast cancers (Fig.\\xa015.5).\\nPure mucinous carcinoma is composed of nests of tumor cells floating in mucin, \\nwhereas the mixed form also contains common infiltrating ductal carcinoma NST \\n(no special type) [33, 34]. There is no definite threshold for the percentage of muci-\\nnous component for discriminating between pure and mixed mucinous carcinoma. \\nHowever, pure mucinous carcinomas are generally composed of more than 90% \\nmucin [35]. The mucin component represents less than 50% in ductal carcinoma \\nwith a mucinous component. Pure mucinous carcinoma is generally diagnosed at \\nolder ages; the median age at diagnosis was 71\\xa0years according to a retrospective \\nreport [36].\\nMedullary carcinoma is characterized by high nuclear grade, lymphocytic infil-\\ntration and a pushing tumor border. Most of the cases present with triple-negative \\nfeatures in addition to cytokeratin 5/6 positivity [37]. The prognosis for pure medul-\\nlary carcinomas appears to be more favorable than that of infiltrating ductal carcino-\\nmas despite an aggressive histological appearance. However, data regarding the \\npotential for metastasis are conflicting; there is evidence suggesting that the risk of \\nmetastasis is equal to that of other high-grade carcinomas, even for cases that meet \\nall pathological criteria for typical medullary carcinoma. In addition, many cases \\nclassified as medullary carcinoma do not have all pathological features on subse-\\nquent pathological review. Since there is concern that patients may be undertreated \\nif a high-grade infiltrating ductal carcinoma is misclassified as typical medullary \\ncarcinoma, it is often recommended that medullary carcinoma be treated like other \\ninfiltrating ductal carcinomas based on tumor size, grade, and lymph node status.\\nAdenoid cystic carcinoma of the breast is a rare entity accounting for less than \\n1% of breast cancers. Morphologically, these cancers resemble adenoid cystic car-\\ncinomas of the salivary glands, with low mitotic activity and good prognosis [38, \\n39]. They are usually HR (−) and HER-2 (−), but in contrast to the common inva-\\nsive ductal type triple-negative breast cancer, the 10-year overall survival rates gen-\\nerally exceed 90%.\\nJuvenile carcinoma or secretory breast carcinoma is a triple-negative subtype of \\nbreast cancer that usually presents at an earlier age [40, 41]. These cancers are also \\n15 Adjuvant Chemotherapy for\\xa0HER2-Negative Early-Stage Breast Cancer 367\\ncharacterized by low Ki67 expression and good prognosis. Rarely, late metastatic or \\nrecurrent cases are reported [42]. Both adenoid cystic carcinomas and secretory \\ncarcinomas are generally triple-negative and are categorized in the good-prognosis \\ngroup with an indolent course, even in the presence of recurrence and metastasis. \\nThus, adjuvant cytotoxic chemotherapy is generally not recommended in the case of \\nnode negativity, but due to the scarcity of data about these rare types of tumors, \\nthere is no strong scientific evidence in favor of adjuvant chemotherapy.\\nIn contrast to adenoid cystic and secretory carcinomas, metaplastic breast cancer \\nrepresents a poorly differentiated subtype with high Ki67 and p53 positivity [43]. \\nThe prognosis is usually poorer than that of triple-negative infiltrating ductal carci-\\nnoma [44]. Survival is generally less than 1\\xa0year in the setting of metastatic disease \\n[45]. The clinical behavior of metaplastic breast cancer may resemble sarcomas or \\nsquamous cell carcinomas, depending on the specific metaplastic differentiation of \\ncells. Although previous studies have demonstrated poor response to neoadjuvant \\nchemotherapy, NCCN guidelines recommend that metaplastic breast carcinoma be \\nevaluated as ductal or lobular carcinoma and treated accordingly [46].\\n Chemotherapy Schedule\\nThe chemotherapy schedule, time and number of cycles depend on the tumor char-\\nacteristics and patient factors, such as biological age, performance status, comorbid \\ndiseases and patient preference. If cytotoxic chemotherapy is to be administered, it \\nshould start within 2–6\\xa0weeks after surgery since delays of more than 12\\xa0weeks may \\ncompromise outcomes significantly. A study by Gagliato et\\xa0al. [47] confirmed the \\nunfavorable effect of delay in the initiation of adjuvant chemotherapy, particularly \\nfor triple-negative and HER2-positive breast cancer subtypes. Patients with TNBC \\nand HER2-positive tumors treated with trastuzumab who started chemotherapy \\n≥61\\xa0days after surgery had significantly worse survival compared with those who \\ninitiated treatment in the first 30\\xa0days after surgery.\\nThe survival benefit of polychemotherapy regimens in the adjuvant setting for \\nbreast cancer was demonstrated long ago in several randomized trials and meta- \\nanalyses. Although initial studies were conducted among patients with higher risk \\nand node-positive disease, subsequent trials encompassing lower-risk groups have \\nextended the spectrum of patients who might benefit from adjuvant chemotherapy. \\nFor instance, the 2005 Early Breast Cancer Trialists’ Collaborative Group \\n(EBCTCG) analysis reviewing polychemotherapy versus no adjuvant chemother-\\napy confirmed significant reductions in both recurrence and mortality rates for early \\nbreast cancer [5].\\nThe type of adjuvant chemotherapy (CT) administered has evolved in the last two \\ndecades. The 2005 review by EBCTCG also included an indirect comparison of \\nadjuvant cyclophosphamide, methotrexate, fluorouracil (CMF) and anthracycline- \\nbased (doxorubicin or epirubicin) chemotherapy and found no significant differ-\\nences in proportional risk reductions in recurrence or breast cancer mortality \\n368 L. Ozer and A. Aydiner\\nbetween the two CT arms. However, the analysis included quite heterogeneous che-\\nmotherapy schemes with varying durations of 6, 9 or 12\\xa0months of treatment. In the \\n2011 EBCTCG meta-analysis, adjuvant chemotherapy using an anthracycline-b ased \\nregimen was compared to no treatment; the use of an anthracycline-based regimen \\nprovided absolute improvements of 8% and 5% in the risk of recurrence and overall \\nmortality, whereas the use of CMF was associated with absolute reductions of 10.2% \\nand 4.7% in the risk of recurrence and overall mortality, respectively, at 10\\xa0years \\n[48]. Although indirect comparisons of the two types of regimens did not indicate an \\nobvious difference in efficacy, directly randomized comparisons in at least two \\nNational Surgical Adjuvant Breast and Bowel Project trials (NSABP-15 and \\nNSABP-23) revealed that four cycles of doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide (AC) \\nwas equal to 6\\xa0months of the classic CMF regimen [49, 50]. In addition, for node-\\npositive disease, cyclophosphamide, epirubicin and 5-fluorouracil (CEF) treatment \\nwas superior to classical CMF in terms of overall and disease-free survival [51]. Due \\nto the convenience of a shorter duration of treatment and fewer hospital visits, most \\nclinicians prefer anthracycline-based regimens based on collective experience.\\nChemotherapy regimens have evolved during the last two decades, particularly \\nwith the introduction of taxanes to early breast cancer treatment. Cancer and \\nLeukemia Group B (CALGB) 9344 was the first randomized trial incorporating \\nsequential paclitaxel therapy for women receiving four cycles of AC chemotherapy \\n[52]. Sequential paclitaxel was associated with improved disease-free and overall \\nsurvival rates. Although not all of the randomized trials were able to demonstrate an \\noverall survival benefit of the incorporation of taxanes in anthracycline-based regi-\\nmens, generally there was a modest DFS benefit, particularly for node-positive dis-\\nease [53, 54]. The efficacy of adjuvant taxanes for node-negative disease was \\ninitially evaluated in the Spanish Breast Cancer Research Group (GEICAM) 9805 \\ntrial; patients with node-negative breast cancer and at least one high-risk factor for \\nrecurrence were assigned to the docetaxel, doxorubicin, cyclophosphamide (TAC) \\nor fluorouracil, doxorubicin, cyclophosphamide (FAC) arms [55]. High-risk factors \\nwere defined as tumor size >2\\xa0cm, negative results on tests for expression of ER and \\nPgR, tumor histological grade 2 or 3, and age <35\\xa0years. Despite significant toxicity, \\nthe TAC regimen significantly reduced the risk of recurrence regardless of hormone- \\nreceptor status, menopausal status or the number of high-risk factors. Meta-analyses \\nfurther confirmed that the addition of taxanes to the adjuvant treatment of high-risk \\nearly breast cancer significantly reduced the risk of death and relapse [56, 57]. It was \\nunknown whether the benefit provided by the addition of taxane would obviate the \\nneed for anthracyclines. While confirmation in larger prospective trials is necessary, \\none randomized trial supported the use of a non-anthracycline regimen. US \\nOncology Trial 9735 assigned stage I-III breast cancer patients to AC or docetaxel/\\ncyclophosphamide (TC) arms. The study indicated significantly higher DFS and OS \\nwith the TC regimen (81% vs 75% and 87% vs 82%, respectively) [58]. A recent \\nmeta-analysis of three adjuvant trials comparing TC for 6 cycles to different AC and \\ntaxane combination regimens did not meet the noninferiority criteria, with a 2.5% \\n4-year IDFS advantage for the AC and taxane combinations. A difference in survival \\nwas only evident for triple-negative and node-positive breast cancer patients [59].\\n15 Adjuvant Chemotherapy for\\xa0HER2-Negative Early-Stage Breast Cancer 369\\nGiven the lack of more prospective randomized data in this setting, an anthracy-\\ncline- and taxane-based CT regimen is recommended for most women with higher \\nrisk factors, but CMF and TC are acceptable alternatives for those with contraindi-\\ncations to anthracyclines.\\nDose-dense treatment, which refers to the administration of drugs with shortened \\nintervals, is based on observations in experimental models that a given dose always \\nkills a certain fraction rather than a certain number of exponentially growing cancer \\ncells [60]. Since human cancer cells in general are supposed to grow by nonexpo-\\nnential Gompertzian kinetics, regrowth of cancer cells between cytoreductive cycles \\nis more rapid than in exponential models, and thus frequent administration of cyto-\\ntoxic therapy with G-CSF support is assumed to be more effective against residual \\ntumor cells. The concept of dose density has been addressed in several trials. The \\nCALGB 9741 trial evaluated concurrent versus sequential chemotherapy (doxoru-\\nbicin followed by paclitaxel followed by cyclophosphamide versus doxorubicin \\nplus cyclophosphamide followed by paclitaxel) given either every 2\\xa0 weeks with \\nG-CSF support or every 3\\xa0weeks [61]. There was no difference between the sequen-\\ntial or concomitant arms, but the dose-dense (every-2-week) arm was associated \\nwith a reduction in the risk of recurrence and death. Another four-arm study by \\nBudd et\\xa0al. [62] also demonstrated that AC every 2\\xa0weeks followed by paclitaxel \\nevery 2\\xa0weeks conferred an OS benefit when compared with the other arms, despite \\nno significant difference in DFS.\\xa0The difference in OS seemed to be confined spe-\\ncifically to the triple-negative subgroup. In contrast to these studies, some trials \\nfailed to demonstrate a survival benefit with dose-dense regimens [63, 64]. More \\nrecently, an Italian phase 3 trial randomized node-positive breast cancer patients to \\nfour treatment arms that included 5-FU and EC followed by paclitaxel or EC fol-\\nlowed by paclitaxel given in 2- or 3-weekly intervals [65]. The study suggested a \\nDFS advantage for dose-dense regimens compared with standard interval chemo-\\ntherapy protocols; in addition, there was no benefit of adding fluorouracil to sequen-\\ntial EC and paclitaxel.\\nA meta-analysis comparing dose-dense regimens with conventional regimens \\nnoted that in some trials, dose-dense treatment was associated with improvements in \\nboth OS and DFS (hazard ratio [HR]: 0.83, 95% Confidence Interval [CI] 0.73–0.94; \\nHR: 0.84, 95%CI 0.72–0.98, respectively), but modified doses or regimens also pro-\\nvided improvement in DFS and OS (HR: 0.81, 95% CI 0.73–0.88; HR: 0.85, 95% \\nCI 0.75–0.96, respectively) [66]. However, the benefit was evident in ER-negative \\ndisease rather than ER-positive disease. Thus, dose-dense strategies appear feasible \\nwith G-CSF support and have a modest impact on outcomes in an unselected patient \\ncohort, but emerging data suggest that specific subtypes, such as triple-negative \\nbreast cancer, may obtain more benefit from intensification of CT [67].\\n Novel Strategies\\nUnfortunately, trials incorporating agents other than anthracyclines and taxanes in the \\nadjuvant setting have not revealed consistently promising results. Capecitabine has \\n370 L. Ozer and A. Aydiner\\nyielded improved outcomes for some subgroups of patients, but overall benefit was \\nlimited. For instance, the phase III FinXX trial integrated capecitabine with sequen-\\ntial docetaxel (T) followed by CEF [68]. Although the interim analysis suggested an \\nincrease in recurrence-free survival (RFS) with capecitabine, the final results failed to \\ndemonstrate an improvement in RFS for the whole patient group [69]. However, in an \\nexploratory subgroup analysis, capecitabine combined with sequential docetaxel fol-\\nlowed by CEX (cyclophosphamide, epirubicin and capecitabine) was more effective \\nthan T+CEF in the subset of patients with TNBC (HR, 0.53).\\nSimilarly, another trial performed among high-risk patients incorporated \\ncapecitabine with sequential AC followed by docetaxel. The study failed to meet its \\nprimary endpoint, DFS, whereas OS was improved with the addition of capecitabine \\n[70]. Recently, a phase III trial evaluated the addition of adjuvant capecitabine for \\npatients with residual breast cancer after neoadjuvant chemotherapy with anthracy-\\ncline, taxane or both. At 5 years, overall survival was longer in the capecitabine \\ngroup than the control group (89.2% vs 83.6%). Among patients with TNBC, the \\nsurvival benefit was more evident [71]. Due to the positive findings in the FinXX \\nand CREATE-X trials, the St Gallen 2017 guidelines recommend considering adju-\\nvant capecitabine combined with anthracyclines and taxanes in the adjuvant setting \\nand for residual cancer after neoadjuvant chemotherapy for the TNBC subtype [31].\\nAll of these studies have pointed at an exceptional status for TNBC patients \\nregarding novel therapies in the adjuvant setting. Most germline mutant BRCA1- \\nassociated breast cancers are TNBC, and some TNBC patients have somatic loss of \\nBRCA1 function due to downregulated BRCA1 transcription or translation [72]. \\nSince BRCA1-associated tumors are deficient in the genes that encode proteins criti-\\ncal in DNA repair, an increased susceptibility to DNA-damaging agents is expected. \\nIn preclinical models of BRCA1-deficient breast cancers, platinum agents have \\nshown increased cytotoxicity through induction of double-strand breaks [73]. The \\ndata for carboplatin and cisplatin in TNBC predominantly emerge from small stud-\\nies and retrospective analyses in the neoadjuvant or metastatic setting [74]. Although \\nthe St Gallen 2017 guidelines recommend platinum-based neoadjuvant chemother-\\napy for TNBC patients, there is no such recommendation for the adjuvant setting.\\nIntegration of targeted agents has also failed to demonstrate survival advantage \\nin the adjuvant setting, similar to colon cancer. The BEATRICE trial randomized \\nTNBC patients to receive a minimum of four cycles of chemotherapy either alone \\nor with bevacizumab [75]. After a median follow-up of 56\\xa0months, the five-year \\ninvasive disease-free survival (IDFS) and OS did not differ between arms. In addi-\\ntion, biomarker analysis did not point at a specific subgroup who may benefit from \\nanti-VEGF therapy.\\n Treatment of\\xa0Pregnant Patients\\nThe majority of breast cancers during pregnancy are invasive ductal carcinomas of \\nrelatively advanced stage, particularly in those diagnosed while lactating [76]. \\n15 Adjuvant Chemotherapy for\\xa0HER2-Negative Early-Stage Breast Cancer 371\\nPhysical examination is hampered by hypertrophy, engorgement and indistinct nod-\\nularity in the pregnant patient’s breast, and densities or nodularities of the gland are \\noften ascribed to benign proliferative changes. These factors often cause a delay in \\ndiagnosis and advanced stage presentation.\\nThe indications for systemic chemotherapy are the same in the pregnant patient \\nas in the non-pregnant breast cancer patient, although chemotherapy should not be \\nadministered at any point during the first trimester of pregnancy due to high risk of \\nfetal malformation. The evidence suggests that the incidence of congenital malfor-\\nmations is low (approximately 1.3%) if chemotherapy is administered to women in \\nthe second or third trimester, after the major period of organogenesis. The estimated \\nrisk of fetal malformation during first-trimester exposure to chemotherapeutics is \\n15–20% [77].\\nThe largest experience to date has been with anthracyclines and alkylating agents \\n[78, 79]. Anthracyclines are mutagenic and carcinogenic in\\xa0vitro and in animals \\n[80]. However, only low concentrations of anthracyclines have been detected in \\nfetal tissues, probably for several reasons. First, the molecular weight of anthracy-\\nclines is greater than 500\\xa0Da, which results in incomplete transfer across the human \\nplacenta. Second, anthracyclines are products of p-glycoprotein, which is a placen-\\ntal drug-transporting glycoprotein that further limits fetal penetration and results in \\nonly barely detectable drug concentrations in the fetus. In a retrospective review \\nfrom a single institution, 81 pregnant breast cancer patients were treated with FAC \\nin the adjuvant or neoadjuvant setting; most of the children exposed to chemother-\\napy in utero grew normally without any significant exposure-related toxicity or \\nhealth problems [81]. Three children were born with congenital abnormalities: one \\neach with Down syndrome, ureteral reflux or clubfoot. The rate of congenital \\n abnormalities in the cohort was similar to the national average of 3%. Moreover, as \\na general rule, breastfeeding during chemotherapy is contraindicated due to the \\nexcretion of cyclophosphamide and doxorubicin in breast milk [82]. Methotrexate \\nis also avoided during pregnancy due to its abortifacient effect and teratogenic \\npotential.\\nCurrently, there are no data encouraging the safe administration of dose-dense \\nAC with or without taxanes. A systematic review of taxane administration during \\npregnancy identified twenty-three publications describing a total of 40 women [83]. \\nNo spontaneous abortions or intrauterine deaths were reported. In two cases of \\nexposure to paclitaxel, acute respiratory distress was possibly related to prematurity \\n[84, 85]. The only malformation possibly related to taxanes was a case of pyloric \\nstenosis in a neonate whom mother had received multiagent chemotherapy (doxoru-\\nbicin, cyclophosphamide, paclitaxel, and docetaxel). Since the safety of taxanes is \\nless well documented than that of anthracyclines, in some situations an additional \\ncycle of anthracycline-based chemotherapy during pregnancy and completion of \\ntaxane-based chemotherapy after delivery can be considered [86]. According to the \\nlimited published data, the major cause of undesirable fetal outcome appears to be \\npremature delivery rather than any direct effect of chemotherapy. Follow-up of chil-\\ndren with specialized assessment, including detailed physiological and neurological \\nfunctions, is necessary (Fig.\\xa015.6).\\n372 L. Ozer and A.

The risk of malformation is high in the \\nfirst trimester for tamoxifen use. Adjuvant trastuzumab is not recommended in pregnancy. \\nHowever, the pregnancy can be continued by informing the patient because there are no sufficient \\ndata regarding the risk of malformation in women who become pregnant under trastuzumab treat-\\nment. Trastuzumab should be discontinued. bPremature delivery should be avoided. In patients \\nreceiving chemotherapy, the last chemotherapy cycle should not be given for a period of 1\\xa0month \\nprior to the estimated date of birth (due to the risk of neutropenia in the baby). Breast conserving \\nsurgery can be performed in pregnancy, but the patient should be informed about the risk of local \\nrecurrence since RT will be performed after delivery (if RT cannot be started within 6\\xa0months after \\nsurgical operation). Blue dye is not used as the SLNB method. The radionuclide method in SLNB \\ncan be used as of the second trimester. Adjuvant RT, endocrine therapy and trastuzumab are \\nadministered after delivery when adjuvant therapy is indicated. Doxorubicin, 5-fluorouracil, and \\ncyclophosphamide (FAC) can be used as chemotherapy (or AC). Ondansetron is preferred for \\nnausea. Although there are no sufficient data yet, weekly paclitaxel can be given after the first tri-\\nmester if there is a clinical indication (e.g., progression under neoadjuvant treatment with \\nanthracycline)\\n Toxicity\\nAnthracyclines are believed to cause immediate damage to cardiac myocytes \\nvia several mechanisms. By activating calcium channels, intracellular calcium \\noverload is triggered, and cardiac contractility may be reduced [87]. Generation \\nof reactive oxygen species that induce sarcomere degeneration, mitochondrial \\nConfirmed breast cancer in a pregnant \\nwoman\\nContinue \\npregnancy\\n15 Adjuvant Chemotherapy for\\xa0HER2-Negative Early-Stage Breast Cancer 373\\ndysfunction, DNA damage and alteration of gene expression can cause apop-\\ntotic and necrotic cell death [88, 89]. Trastuzumab for HER2-positive disease \\nand adjuvant radiotherapy further contribute to cardiac dysfunction. The most \\ncommon serious clinical cardiac complications that have been reported are \\narrhythmias, myocardial necrosis causing dilated cardiomyopathy, and vaso-\\nocclusion or vasospasm resulting in angina or myocardial infarction. Reported \\nheart failure rates associated with epirubicin range from 0.6% at a cumulative \\ndose of 550\\xa0mg/m2 to 14.5% at a cumulative dose of 1000\\xa0mg/m2 [90]. A report \\nof 630 patients treated with doxorubicin alone in three controlled trials esti-\\nmated that as many as 26% of patients receiving a cumulative doxorubicin dose \\nof 550\\xa0mg/m2 would develop heart failure [91]. Based upon these observations, \\nit has been generally recommended that cumulative doses be limited to 450–\\n500\\xa0mg/m2 for doxorubicin and 900\\xa0mg/m2 for epirubicin in adults. The inci-\\ndence of heart failure associated with taxanes according to retrospective analysis \\nis relatively low, with a range of 2.3–8% for docetaxel [92]. For patients under-\\ngoing adjuvant chemotherapy, baseline cardiovascular examination should \\ninclude management of risk factors such as hypertension and hyperlipidemia to \\navoid further cardiac damage.\\nA frustrating late side effect of alkylating agents is myelodysplasia (MDS) \\nand bone marrow neoplasms. In 2003, the National Surgical Adjuvant Breast \\nand Bowel Project (NSABP) reported a 0.27% eight-year cumulative incidence \\nof MDS and/or acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) among patients with \\nbreast cancer treated with doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide [93]. Two \\ngenetic variants of therapy-related AML have been described: one after anthra-\\ncyclines and/or topoisomerase inhibitors with a median latent period of \\n1–3\\xa0years and another after alkylating agents with median latency of 4–6\\xa0years, \\noften preceded by MDS [94]. A recent study of bone marrow neoplasms fol-\\nlowing adjuvant chemotherapy for breast cancer revealed a slightly higher inci-\\ndence (0.4–0.5% at 10\\xa0years) that was slightly higher than previously described. \\nThe effect of G-CSF was not evaluated, and taxane use did not increase myeloid \\nneoplasms [95].\\nThe most common side effect encountered due to taxanes is neurotoxicity. In \\na recent study, upon completion of docetaxel chemotherapy, 23% of patients \\nreported grade 2–4 peripheral neuropathy (PN), and one third of these patients \\nreported persistent symptoms 1–3\\xa0years later [96]. Among those without PN \\ninitially, 10% developed PN 1–3\\xa0years after. In 2014, the American Society of \\nClinical Oncology published a clinical practice guideline on chemotherapy-\\ninduced peripheral neuropathy (CIPN); no agent was offered for the prevention \\nof CIPN due to a lack of consistent evidence [97]. However, for the treatment \\nof CIPN, the guidelines recommend duloxetine, based on efficacy data from a \\nlarge randomized placebo- controlled trial [98]. Patients who received dulox-\\netine reported a significant decrease in pain, numbness and tingling symptoms \\ncompared with placebo. Exploratory subgroup analysis suggested that dulox-\\netine may be more efficacious for oxaliplatin-induced than for paclitaxel-\\ninduced painful neuropathy.\\n374 L. Ozer and A.

Ozer and A. Aydiner\\ncytotoxic treatment is of no use or adjuvant hormone therapy is inadequate. Thus, \\ntreatment-oriented classification of subgroups of breast cancer is essential. For \\ntriple- negative breast cancer, adjuvant cytotoxic chemotherapy is recommended for \\ntumors ≥5\\xa0 mm. Without markers of lower endocrine responsiveness (Luminal \\nA-like) disease, chemotherapy may be considered if four or more nodes are involved. \\nThus, with high ER/PR expression and clearly low Ki67, adjuvant endocrine ther-\\napy is usually adequate for tumors up to 5\\xa0cm (T1 and T2) with low or absent nodal \\ninvolvement. For low ER/PR expression, high proliferation markers and high tumor \\nburden (Luminal B-like) or multiparameter molecular tests suggesting an ‘unfavor-\\nable prognosis’, cytotoxic chemotherapy is recommended. Extensive nodal involve-\\nment, histological grade 3, extensive lymphovascular invasion, and larger T size \\n(T3) are also considered indications for adjuvant chemotherapy. Anthracyclines and \\ntaxanes are the mainstay of adjuvant cytotoxic chemotherapy, although platinums \\ncan be considered for TNBC patients with known BRCA mutations. Adjuvant \\ncapecitabine for residual cancer after neoadjuvant chemotherapy may confer a sur-\\nvival benefit. Dose-dense regimens should be reserved mainly for patients with \\ntriple- negative breast cancer and extensive nodal involvement. Prevention and treat-\\nment of early and late side effects of chemotherapy requires life-long follow-up and \\ndetailed evaluation of each treatment and patient-related factors.\\nReferences\\n 1.

Although chemotherapy has improved outcomes for patients, the marginal ben-\\nefits achieved with cytotoxic agents seem to have reached a plateau. Fortunately, \\ntechnological advances have enabled the characterization of the molecular subtypes \\n[2, 3] of breast cancer, which has, in turn, facilitated the development of molecu-\\nlarly targeted therapeutics for this disease. One subtype is distinguished by amplifi-\\ncation of the gene encoding human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2). \\nThis subtype accounts for approximately 20–30% of invasive breast cancers, and \\nuntil the discovery of effective anti-HER2 therapies (the first of which was trastu-\\nzumab), was associated with reduced disease-free survival (DFS), increased risk of \\nmetastasis and shorter overall survival (OS) [4, 5]. By 2005, the natural history of \\nthis breast cancer subtype in the adjuvant setting was forever changed with the \\nrelease of the findings of first-generation adjuvant trials that combined trastuzumab \\nwith chemotherapy, concomitantly or sequentially.\\nHER2 is a member of the ErbB family of receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs), which \\nincludes HER1 (epidermal growth factor receptor [EGFR]), HER3, and HER4. \\nHER2-mediated signal transduction is believed to depend largely on heterodimeriza-\\ntion with other family members [5]. Trastuzumab is a humanized monoclonal anti-\\nbody that targets the extracellular portion of HER2. This was the first HER2-targeted \\nagent to be approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for \\nthe treatment of both early-stage and metastatic H ER2- overexpressing (HER2+) \\nS.

Subsequently, lapatinib, an orally bioavailable small-molecule \\ndual HER2- and EGFR/HER1-specific tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI), received \\nFDA approval in combination with capecitabine for patients with advanced HER2+ \\nbreast cancer [8]. Pertuzumab in 2012 and ado-t rastuzumab emtansine in 2013 were \\nsubsequently approved in the US and elsewhere based on evidence showing an \\nimprovement in survival outcomes in patients with mostly trastuzumab-naïve or \\ntrastuzumab-exposed metastatic disease [9, 10]. The clinical benefit demonstrated by \\nthose drugs in advanced disease has triggered several adjuvant and neoadjuvant trials \\ntesting them in combination with chemotherapy but also without conventional che-\\nmotherapy, using single or dual HER2-t argeting drugs. In this chapter, we review the \\ncurrent data on the therapeutic management of HER2-positive early-stage breast \\ncancer in the adjuvant and neoadjuvant settings.\\n Defining HER2-Positive Breast Cancer\\nA key first step in appropriately deciding on the use of HER2-targeted therapy is the \\naccurate determination of HER2 overexpression either by immunohistochemistry \\n(IHC) or fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH). The 2013 American Society of \\nClinical Oncology (ASCO)/College of American Pathologists (CAP) guidelines \\ndefine HER2 positivity as 3+ on IHC (defined as uniform intense membrane stain-\\ning of >10% of invasive tumor cells) or amplified on FISH (a HER2:chromosome \\nenumeration probe [CEP]17 ratio of >2.0, or <2.0 plus average HER2 copy number \\n>6 signals/cell) [11]. Recently updated 2018 ASCO/CAP HER2 testing guidelines \\naddressed specific testing strategies to better define and distinguish HER2 status of \\ntumors. Specifically, the draft update recommends: the addition of IHC testing in \\nthe same laboratory or institution performing ISH as part of the evaluation of less \\ncommon patterns observed with dual-probe ISH testing. In cases where the recom-\\nmended testing strategy does not resolve the clinical concerns, the draft update cur-\\nrently states that pathologists may obtain second opinions. The draft update no \\nlonger recommends alternative probe testing in the guideline algorithm for dual \\nprobe ISH testing.\\nAlthough a detailed discussion of HER2 testing is beyond the scope of this chap-\\nter, we would like to note that if a patient’s HER2 expression is ultimately deemed \\nto be equivocal on both IHC and FISH, the oncologist can still consider HER2- \\ntargeted therapy based on the patient’s history, prognosis, and comorbidities.\\n Anti-HER-2 Therapy for\\xa0Early-Stage Breast Cancer\\nIn this section, we summarize all the relevant phase III and some phase II clinical \\ntrials that constitute the theoretical framework to support our daily practice.

Trastuzumab and pertuzumab are recommended in neoadjuvant \\ntherapy. The St Gallen panel did not support dual HER2 blockade with pertuzumab or lapatinib in \\nthe postoperative adjuvant treatment. According to the APHINITY study, which published the early \\nresults, adjuvant trastuzumab\\xa0+\\xa0pertuzumab treatment prolonged disease-free survival in HER2-\\npositive patients. This benefit was particularly evident in high-risk patients who were hormone \\nreceptor negative and node positive. According to a randomized controlled trial, 1-year neratinib \\nuse after 1-year administration of trastuzumab reduced the recurrence rate. This benefit was espe-\\ncially evident in ER-positive, Her-2-positive disease. However, diarrhea was an important adverse \\neffect. After 1\\xa0year of trastuzumab administration in hormone receptor-positive patients, 1\\xa0year of \\nneratinib can be used. cIn high-risk premenopausal patients, “LHRH-agonist\\xa0+\\xa0aromatase inhibitor” \\nmay be the preferred adjuvant endocrine therapy.

Bayraktar and A. Aydiner\\ndiagnosis, 8\\xa0months). Patients with HER2-positive disease were eligible if node- \\npositive or node-negative with tumor >1\\xa0cm (T1c). At a median follow-up of 4\\xa0years, \\none year of adjuvant trastuzumab led to a 24% reduction in recurrence (HR: 0.76, \\nP\\xa0<\\xa00.0001). However, partly due to the significant crossover (65%) from the obser-\\nvation arm to trastuzumab after the first results were released, the OS benefit from \\ntrastuzumab in HERA became apparent when evaluated after 4\\xa0years (HR: 0.85, \\nP\\xa0=\\xa00.11) [14]. A recent update after a median follow-up of 8\\xa0years confirmed the \\nDFS (HR: 0.76, P\\xa0<\\xa00.0001) and OS benefit (HR: 0.76, P\\xa0=\\xa00.0005) from one year \\nof trastuzumab [13]. However, there was no incremental benefit from a longer dura-\\ntion of trastuzumab (2\\xa0years), and more cardiac events were observed.\\nCardiotoxicity is the most important adverse effect of treatment with trastu-\\nzumab and is worsened when combined with anthracyclines. Therefore, there has \\nbeen a special interest in studying anthracycline-free regimens to minimize the car-\\ndiotoxicity risk. The BCIRG 006 [15] study was designed to provide information on \\nthis issue. Patients received AC followed by docetaxel (AC\\xa0→\\xa0T), AC followed by \\ndocetaxel with 1\\xa0year of trastuzumab (AC\\xa0→\\xa0TH), or docetaxel plus carboplatin and \\ntrastuzumab followed by trastuzumab to complete 1\\xa0year of therapy (TCH). After \\n65\\xa0months of follow-up, DFS was significantly improved with the addition of trastu-\\nzumab to chemotherapy (AC\\xa0→\\xa0T: 75%, AC\\xa0→\\xa0TH: 84%, and TCH 81%; HR for \\nAC-TH was 0.64 (P\\xa0<\\xa00.001) and for TCH was 0.75 (P\\xa0=\\xa00.04) with a significant \\nimprovement in OS (AC\\xa0→\\xa0T: 87% vs AC\\xa0→\\xa0TH: 92%; HR: 0.63, P\\xa0<\\xa00.001), and \\nTCH 91% (HR: 0.77, P\\xa0=\\xa00.038). However, despite the apparent numerical advan-\\ntage of AC\\xa0→\\xa0TH over TCH, the study was not designed to directly compare these \\ntwo arms. To confirm that one regimen is better than the other, further evidence is \\nrequired. Additionally, the incidence of cardiac toxicity was five times greater with \\nACTH (2%) compared with TCH (0.4%). Reductions in LVEF of greater than 10% \\nfrom basal measurements were more frequently associated with AC\\xa0→\\xa0 TH than \\nwith TCH (18.6 vs 9.4%; P\\xa0<\\xa00.001). In addition, the rate of symptomatic conges-\\ntive heart failure favored treatment with TCH (P\\xa0<\\xa00.001).\\nThe only trial that did not show a survival benefit from adjuvant trastuzumab was \\nFNCLCC-PACS-04 [16]. A total of 3010 patients with early-stage breast cancer \\nwere randomly assigned to adjuvant treatment with anthracycline-based chemo-\\ntherapy with or without docetaxel. Patients with HER-2 over-amplified tumors \\n(n\\xa0=\\xa0528) were subsequently randomized to receive trastuzumab sequentially every \\n3\\xa0weeks. The primary endpoint was DFS.\\xa0Treatment with trastuzumab resulted in a \\nnonsignificant 14% reduction in the risk of relapse (P\\xa0=\\xa00.41), and there was no dif-\\nference in OS.\\xa0However, 10% of the patients assigned to trastuzumab were never \\ntreated, and 25% of patients discontinued before the 16th cycle. In addition, sequen-\\ntial use seemed to be inferior to concurrent use of trastuzumab and chemotherapy.\\n Shorter Duration of\\xa0Trastuzumab\\nThe duration of adjuvant treatment in HER2-positive breast cancer is a current topic \\nof discussion. Based on the previously analyzed HERA trial, 2\\xa0years of treatment \\nwith trastuzumab is not superior to 1\\xa0year. There is a special interest in investigating \\n16 Adjuvant Therapy for\\xa0HER2-Positive Early-Stage Breast Cancer 391\\nwhether treatment duration could be shortened due to concerns about cardiotoxicity. \\nIn the early 2000s, the Finland Herceptin (FinHER) trial [17] aimed to determine \\nthe role of vinorelbine compared to docetaxel in the adjuvant setting in patients with \\nnode-positive and high-risk node-negative breast cancer and tested a shorter course \\nof trastuzumab. A total of 1010 patients were randomized to treatment with vinorel-\\nbine or docetaxel for 3 cycles followed by three cycles of 5-FU, epirubicin and \\ncyclophosphamide. A group of 232 patients with HER-2-amplified tumors were \\nagain randomized to receive nine weekly cycles of trastuzumab concurrently with \\ndocetaxel or vinorelbine. The primary endpoint was distant DFS, and with a median \\nfollow-up of 62\\xa0 months, it favored treatment with docetaxel over vinorelbine \\n(P\\xa0=\\xa00.010). OS also tended to be better in patients treated with docetaxel compared \\nto vinorelbine (39 vs 55 deaths, respectively; P\\xa0=\\xa00.086). In HER-2-positive patients, \\nthe trastuzumab arms had favorable recurrence-free survival irrespective of the che-\\nmotherapy regimen (80% vs 73%; P\\xa0=\\xa00.12). This benefit was maintained when \\nadjusted for nodal involvement and in patients treated with docetaxel over vinorel-\\nbine. The main limitation of this trial is the small number of patients with HER-2- \\npositive tumors that were included, which reduced the power of the study to detect \\na statistically significant benefit with trastuzumab. In addition, even though the \\nresults suggested a benefit in patients treated with trastuzumab in combination with \\nchemotherapy, the short course of treatment might have underestimated the real \\nefficacy of the drug in this population.\\nThe PHARE trial [18] is a noninferiority study designed to evaluate adjuvant \\ntreatment length with trastuzumab for 6\\xa0months compared to 1\\xa0year. A total of 1691 \\npatients were treated with trastuzumab for 12\\xa0months and 1693 for 6\\xa0months after \\nreceiving at least 4 cycles of adjuvant chemotherapy. Patients were stratified accord-\\ning to sequential or concurrent treatment and estrogen-receptor (ER) status. The \\nprimary endpoint was DFS, and with a median follow-up of 42.5\\xa0months, the 2-year \\nDFS was 93.8% for the 12-month group and 91.1% for the 6-month group (HR: \\n1.28; 95% CI: 1.05–1.56), indicating that 6\\xa0months of treatment did not reach the \\nnoninferiority criteria. However, cardiac events were more common in the 12-month \\ntreatment arm (5.7% vs 1.9%; P\\xa0<\\xa00.001), and further analysis is still required.\\nFinHER investigators are now comparing 9\\xa0weeks of trastuzumab plus docetaxel \\nand FEC with the same regimen followed by 1\\xa0year of trastuzumab therapy in the \\nSOLD study (NCT00593697). SHORT-HER (NCT00629278) is testing 9\\xa0 weeks \\nversus 12\\xa0months of trastuzumab. Two other studies in progress are testing 6 versus \\n12\\xa0months of trastuzumab, including PERSEPHONE (NCT00712140) and a trial \\nby the Hellenic Oncology Research Group (NCT00615602). On the basis of current \\navailable evidence, 12\\xa0months of adjuvant treatment with trastuzumab remains the \\nstandard of care.\\n Lapatinib\\nLapatinib is currently approved for metastatic disease, but its use has also been \\nevaluated in the adjuvant setting due to its oral bioavailability. The TEACH trial \\n[19] studied the efficacy of lapatinib in trastuzumab-naïve patients as adjuvant \\n392 S. Bayraktar and A. Aydiner\\ntreatment. A total of 3147 patients were randomized to treatment with lapatinib or \\nplacebo for 12\\xa0months or until progression. DFS was non-significantly prolonged in \\npatients treated with lapatinib (87% vs 83%; P\\xa0=\\xa00.09). In patients with centrally \\nconfirmed HER-2 status, the HR was 0.92 (P\\xa0=\\xa00.94). In the ALTTO trial (Adjuvant \\nLapatinib and/or Trastuzumab Treatment Optimisation) [20], the investigators \\nhypothesized that in the adjuvant setting, two HER2-targeted agents would be supe-\\nrior to trastuzumab alone in preventing breast cancer recurrences. It was the largest- \\never adjuvant clinical trial in HER2-positive breast cancer, involving 8381 women \\nfrom 946 centers in 44 countries. Patients were randomly assigned to 1\\xa0 year of \\nadjuvant therapy with trastuzumab (T), lapatinib (L), their sequence (T\\xa0→\\xa0L), or \\ntheir combination (L\\xa0+\\xa0T). In 2011, due to futility to demonstrate noninferiority of \\nL versus T, the L arm was closed, and patients free of disease were offered adjuvant \\nT.\\xa0The primary endpoint was disease-free survival (DFS), with 850 events required \\nfor 80% power to detect a hazard ratio (HR) of 0.8 for L\\xa0+\\xa0T versus T.\\xa0At a median \\nfollow-up of 4.5\\xa0 years, dual targeting—either concurrently or sequentially—was \\nassociated with slight numerical reductions in disease recurrences, but the differ-\\nences were not statistically significant vs trastuzumab alone. The disease-free sur-\\nvival rates at 4\\xa0 years were 86% with trastuzumab, 88% with concurrent \\nHER2-directed treatment, and 87% in the sequential T arm (555 DFS events; HR: \\n0.84; 97.5% CI: 0.70–1.02; P\\xa0=\\xa00.048). Median overall survival rates were 94%, \\n95%, and 95%, respectively (HR: 0.96; 97.5% CI: 0.80–1.15; P\\xa0=\\xa00.61). Updated \\n10-year results from the phase III ALTTO trial presented at the ASCO 2017 annual \\nmeeting showed a stronger benefit of the dual HER2 agents in patients with \\nER-negative breast cancer. The HRs for this updated analysis were similar to those \\nfrom the primary analysis, and the event rate remains lower than anticipated (705 vs \\n850 planned) [21]. This analysis suggests that HER2+/ER− tumors may have a dif-\\nferent biology than HER2+/ER+ and may benefit more from dual HER2 blockade. \\nLapatinib was also associated with significant increases in adverse events—diar-\\nrhea, skin rash or erythema, and hepatobiliary problems. In conclusion, lapatinib \\neither as a single agent or in combination with trastuzumab seems to be quite inef-\\nfective and more toxic in the adjuvant setting.\\n Adjuvant Therapy for\\xa0Tumors Smaller than 1\\xa0cm\\nData on the role of trastuzumab in small node-negative tumors remain scarce. \\nRetrospective institutional series from MD Anderson Cancer Center (MDACC) [22] \\nand Milan [23] suggest that small HER2-positive tumors prognostically have a poor \\nlong-term outcome compared to their HER2-negative counterparts. Subgroup anal-\\nyses from several randomized trials have shown a benefit of adjuvant trastuzumab \\nirrespective of tumor size [24], though its actual absolute benefit in small stage 1 \\ntumors (such as those with T1a up to 0.5\\xa0cm disease) remains unknown. A large, \\nretrospective European study [25] compared the outcomes of patients with T1a/b \\nnode-negative tumors who either received adjuvant trastuzumab-based chemother-\\napy or did not and demonstrated a statistically significant 2–3% improvement in \\n16 Adjuvant Therapy for\\xa0HER2-Positive Early-Stage Breast Cancer 393\\nrecurrence-free survival in the trastuzumab arm after a multivariate analysis. \\nHormone receptor (HR) status was also notable, as larger differences were seen in \\npatients with high-risk features such as HR-negative or positive lymphatic vascular \\ninvasion. Therefore, it stands to reason that we could treat these tumors with adju-\\nvant trastuzumab, especially if they are T1b or have other poor risk features.\\nA single-arm multicenter trial [26] included breast cancer patients with node- \\nnegative tumors up to 3\\xa0cm. Patients received weekly treatment with paclitaxel and \\ntrastuzumab for 12\\xa0weeks, followed by 9\\xa0months of trastuzumab monotherapy. The \\nprimary endpoint was survival free from invasive disease. The 3-year rate of sur-\\nvival free from invasive disease was 98.7% (95% CI: 97.6–99.8). The results sug-\\ngest a low risk of cancer recurrence (less than 2% at 3\\xa0years) with a regimen in \\nwhich the rate of serious toxic effects was low (with an incidence of heart failure \\nthat was only 0.5%). At the ASCO 2017 annual meeting, an updated analysis with \\n7-year DFS was provided [27]. The 7-year DFS was 93.3% (95% CI: 90.4–96.2); \\n7-year DFS was 94.6% for ER+ pts (95% CI: 91.8–97.5) and 90.7% for ER− pts \\n(95% CI: 84.6–97.2). Moreover, 7-year recurrence-free interval (RFI) was 97.5% \\n(95% CI: 95.9–99.1); 7-year breast cancer-specific survival (BCSS) was 98.6% \\n(95% CI: 97.0–100); and 7-year OS was 95.0% (95% CI: 92.4–97.7). These data \\nsuggest that TH as adjuvant therapy for node-negative HER2+ breast cancer was \\nassociated with few recurrences and only 4 distant recurrences with longer follow-\\n up. In the absence of randomized data, this regimen might become an option for \\npatients with small node-negative HER2-positive disease in clinical scenarios where \\nthere is concern about potential toxicity from established regimens.\\n Ongoing Adjuvant Trials\\nSeveral drugs are under intensive study for use in the adjuvant therapy of HER2- \\npositive breast cancer: trastuzumab, pertuzumab (Perjeta), ado-trastuzumab emtan-\\nsine (formerly known as T-DM1 [Kadcyla]), and the investigational tyrosine kinase \\ninhibitor neratinib (Table\\xa016.2).\\nThe BETH trial is evaluating the blockade of both the HER2 and vascular endo-\\nthelial growth factor (VEGF) pathways by combining trastuzumab with the anti- \\nVEGF monoclonal antibody bevacizumab, based on preclinical data showing a \\ncorrelation between HER2 and VEGF expression [28, 29]. In the BETH trial [30], \\nmore than 3000 patients were treated with docetaxel plus carboplatin (TC) with \\ntrastuzumab versus TC with trastuzumab and bevacizumab, and targeted therapy \\nwas given for one year in both arms. The researchers found that after a median of \\n38\\xa0months of follow-up, DFS was 92% for both arms of the TCH cohort. In addi-\\ntion, the results of the trial were negative for any benefit of adding bevacizumab to \\nadjuvant therapy for HER2-positive breast cancer. This lack of benefit may have \\noccurred because 92% of the patients in the TCH control arm remained disease-free \\nafter a median follow-up of 38\\xa0months. This trial also demonstrated that it is not \\nnecessary to include an anthracycline as part of the treatment regimen, even for \\nlarge tumors or node-positive disease.\\n394 S. Bayraktar and A.

The results of \\nthe APHINITY trial were presented at the ASCO 2017 Annual meeting [33]. In this \\nphase III clinical trial of 4805 women with HER2-positive breast cancer, the addi-\\ntion of pertuzumab to trastuzumab reduced the chance of developing invasive breast \\ncancer by 19% compared to trastuzumab alone. At a median follow-up of almost \\n4\\xa0years, 171 patients (7.1%) in the pertuzumab group had developed invasive breast \\ncancer, compared to 210 patients (8.7%) in the placebo group. At 3\\xa0years, an esti-\\nmated 94.1% of patients in the pertuzumab group were free of invasive breast can-\\ncer, compared to 93.2% of patients in the placebo group. The rates of serious side \\neffects were low and similar in both groups—heart failure or heart-related death \\noccurred in 0.7% of patients in the pertuzumab group and 0.3% of patients in the \\nplacebo group. Severe diarrhea was more common with pertuzumab, occurring in \\n9.8% of patients compared to 3.7% of those who received placebo. The results of \\nAPHINITY trial led to full FDA approval. Based on the phase III APHINITY data, \\nASCO updated their recommendations in 2018 stating that 1\\xa0year of pertuzumab \\nmay be offered in addition to trastuzumab and combination chemotherapy for \\npatients with high-risk, early-stage breast cancer, such as those with node-positive \\ndisease. 2018 ASCO updated guidelines stressed that APHINITY data showed no \\nclinically meaningful benefit among patients with node-negative breast cancer and \\nthe first planned interim analysis did not show an OS benefit. Importantly, there are \\nno data to guide the duration of pertuzumab treatment in patients who received \\nneoadjuvant pertuzumab and achieved a pathologic complete response.\\n16 Adjuvant Therapy for\\xa0HER2-Positive Early-Stage Breast Cancer 395\\nThe KATHERINE trial (NCT01772472) [34] is comparing 14 cycles of ado- \\ntrastuzumab emtansine versus 14 cycles of trastuzumab in patients with HER2- \\npositive disease and less than a pathologic complete response (pCR) after \\npreoperative therapy with a trastuzumab-based regimen. Fifty-percent of planned \\nenrollment is completed. The primary endpoint of the study is DFS.\\nNeratinib is an irreversible pan-HER tyrosine kinase inhibitor with clinical effi-\\ncacy in trastuzumab pre-treated HER2-positive (HER2+) metastatic breast cancer. \\nThe ExteNET study examined sequential therapy with 1\\xa0year of trastuzumab fol-\\nlowed by 1\\xa0year of neratinib in stage 2–3c Her2+ breast cancer patients who had \\nreceived the last dose of trastuzumab within the last 1\\xa0year before enrollment in the \\nclinical trial [35]. In this study, eligible women with stage 1–3c (modified to stage \\n2–3c in February 2010) operable breast cancer who had completed neoadjuvant and \\nadjuvant chemotherapy plus trastuzumab with no evidence of disease recurrence or \\nmetastatic disease at study entry were randomly assigned according to hormone \\nreceptor status (ER-positive vs ER-negative), nodal status (0 vs 1–3 vs or ≥4 posi-\\ntive nodes), and trastuzumab adjuvant regimen (given sequentially vs concurrently \\nwith chemotherapy), followed by 1\\xa0year of oral neratinib 240\\xa0mg/day or matching \\nplacebo. After a median follow-up of 5.2\\xa0years (IQR 2.1–5.3), patients in the nera-\\ntinib group had significantly fewer invasive DFS events than those in the placebo \\ngroup (116 vs 163 events; stratified hazard ratio 0.73, 95% CI: 0.57–0.92, \\nP\\xa0=\\xa00.0083). Five-year invasive disease-free survival was 90.2% (95% CI: 88.3–\\n91.8) in the neratinib group and 87.7% (85.7–89.4) in the placebo group. Without \\ndiarrhea prophylaxis, the most common grade 3–4 adverse events in the neratinib \\ngroup compared with the placebo group were diarrhea (561 [40%] grade 3 and one \\n[<1%] grade 4 with neratinib vs 23 [2%] grade 3 with placebo), vomiting (grade 3: \\n47 [3%] vs five [<1%]), and nausea (grade 3: 26 [2%] vs two [<1%]). Treatment- \\nemergent serious adverse events occurred in 103 (7%) women in the neratinib group \\nand 85 (6%) women in the placebo group. No evidence of increased risk of long- \\nterm toxicity or long-term adverse consequences of neratinib-associated diarrhea \\nwere identified with neratinib compared with placebo. This study led to FDA \\napproval of 1\\xa0year of extended adjuvant therapy with neratinib on July 17, 2017, to \\nfollow adjuvant trastuzumab-based therapy. ASCO 2018 guidelines reported their \\nrecommendations about neratinib use in patients with HER2-positive early breast \\ncancer. The expert panel emphasized that the observed benefit from neratinib was \\nhigher in hormone receptor-positive and node-positive patients, and no OS advan-\\ntage has been observed thus far. Patients who began neratinib within 1\\xa0 year of \\ntrastuzumab completion appeared to derive the greatest benefit. Currently there are \\nno reported data on the incremental benefit offered by neratinib in patients who \\ncompleted up to a year of pertuzumab in the neoadjuvant or adjuvant setting.\\n Neoadjuvant Setting\\nIn the last decade, researchers have modernized trial design by using pCR as an \\nendpoint, since pCR correlates with long-term outcome and is quicker than waiting, \\n396 S.

Consequently, researchers have \\nexamined the impact of HER2-targeted agents on pCR in the neoadjuvant setting \\n(Table\\xa016.3).\\nThe results of the NOAH trial, a randomized phase III study, increased enthusi-\\nasm for this approach [36]. The study was originally designed to compare neoadju-\\nvant chemotherapy plus trastuzumab followed by 1-year trastuzumab to neoadjuvant \\nchemotherapy alone in patients with locally advanced or inflammatory HER-2 posi-\\ntive tumors. Among the 238 patients who were originally randomized to neoadjuvant \\ntreatment with or without trastuzumab, the addition of anti-HER-2 therapy improved \\npCR from 22% to 43% (P\\xa0<\\xa00.001). Trastuzumab also resulted in a 40% reduction of \\nthe risk of recurrence, progression or death compared to chemotherapy alone.\\n16 Adjuvant Therapy for\\xa0HER2-Positive Early-Stage Breast Cancer 397\\nThe value of overlapping anthracycline with trastuzumab in the neoadjuvant set-\\nting was explored in the American Z1041 trial [37], which randomized 282 women \\nwith HER-2-positive and ≥2-cm tumors to receive trastuzumab and paclitaxel con-\\ncurrently with of after FEC-75. There was no difference in pCR for sequential ver-\\nsus overlapping anthracycline and trastuzumab (54% and 56%), but the concurrent \\nuse of anthracyclines and trastuzumab resulted in a greater drop in the cardiac ejec-\\ntion fraction (2.9% vs 0.8% at 12\\xa0weeks, respectively). Finally, similar rates of pCR \\nwere described in patients treated with chemotherapy and trastuzumab in the \\nHannaH trial (41% and 45% for intravenous vs subcutaneous trastuzumab, respec-\\ntively) [38]. A slightly higher incidence of serious AEs (SAEs), mainly due to infec-\\ntions, was reported with subcutaneous treatment; however, the differences were \\nsmall and often based on rare events, with no observable pattern across reported \\nevents. An early analysis of DFS showed rates of 95% in both groups 1\\xa0 year \\npost-randomization.\\nIn an attempt to improve pCR, some researchers have begun exploring the use of \\nother anti-HER2 blockers alone or in combination with trastuzumab in the neoadju-\\nvant setting. In the German GeparQuinto study [39], 620 patients received four \\ncycles of epirubicin and cyclophosphamide (EC) followed by docetaxel and were \\nrandomized to either trastuzumab or lapatinib. All patients received standard-of- care \\ntrastuzumab for 1\\xa0year after surgical resection. The primary outcome was pCR, and \\ntrastuzumab yielded approximately 7% more complete responses than lapatinib \\n(30.3% vs 22.7%; P\\xa0=\\xa00.04). Given these results and the significant number of adverse \\nevents described in this study, it is unlikely that lapatinib could replace trastuzumab \\nin the neoadjuvant setting; dual HER-2 inhibition appears to be a better option.\\nIn four trials examining combinations of trastuzumab with lapatinib or pertu-\\nzumab—including NeoALTTO (NCT00553358) and Neo-Sphere \\n(NCT00545688)—dual blockade resulted in a higher pCR rate. NeoALTTO, an \\ninternational, randomized, phase III study, compared the use of single-agent lapa-\\ntinib, trastuzumab or the combination of both in addition to paclitaxel for neoadju-\\nvant treatment [40]. Interestingly, the combination arm showed a remarkable \\nimprovement in pCR that nearly duplicated that in the two single-agent anti-HER2 \\narms (51% vs 29.5% trastuzumab vs 24.7% lapatinib; P\\xa0<\\xa00.001). As expected, the \\naddition of lapatinib resulted in worse side effects, mainly related to diarrhea and \\nrash. However, in contrast to NeoALTTO, the NSABP B-41 study showed no sig-\\nnificant difference between the combination of trastuzumab and lapatinib and either \\ndrug used as a single agent [41]. Two issues warrant further discussion. First, even \\nthough the populations included in both trials were similar, the chemotherapy regi-\\nmens were not. In the NSABP study, all patients received four cycles of AC and then \\nwere randomized to paclitaxel plus trastuzumab, lapatinib or both. Second, the rates \\nof pCR in all three arms were unusually high (62% for the combination, 53% for \\ntrastuzumab and 52.5% for lapatinib).\\nThe FDA has recently granted accelerated approval to pertuzumab for use before \\nsurgery when combined with trastuzumab and chemotherapy. This controversial \\ndecision was based on the results of two phase II clinical trials. The NeoSphere trial \\n[42] was a multicenter, open-label, randomized phase II study in which 417 patients \\n398 S. Bayraktar and A. Aydiner\\nwere randomized to one of four possible arms: pertuzumab (P)\\xa0 +\\xa0 trastuzumab \\n(T)\\xa0+\\xa0docetaxel (Do); T\\xa0+\\xa0Do; P\\xa0+\\xa0Do or P\\xa0+\\xa0T alone. All eligible patients then \\nunderwent surgical resection followed by adjuvant FEC and 1\\xa0year of trastuzumab. \\nThe three-drug arm (P\\xa0+\\xa0T\\xa0+ Do) yielded the maximal rate of pCR (46%) and was \\nsignificantly different from T\\xa0 +\\xa0 Do (29%; P\\xa0 =\\xa0 0.014). Pertuzumab\\xa0 +\\xa0 docetaxel \\nresulted in a 24% pCR, and the chemotherapy-free arm had a 17% pCR.\\xa0 In the \\nT\\xa0+\\xa0Do and P\\xa0+\\xa0T\\xa0+\\xa0D0 arms, respectively, the 3-year survival rates were 85% and \\n92% for DFS (HR: 0.60, 95% CI: 0.28–1.27) and 86% and 90% for PFS (HR: 0.69, \\n95% CI: 0.34–1.40). Importantly, the addition of pertuzumab did not produce any \\nsignificant drop in cardiac function (4–5% EF drop across all groups). An additional \\nneoadjuvant phase II trial (TRYPHAENA) [43] was conducted in 225 patients with \\nHER2-positive, locally advanced, operable, or inflammatory breast cancer and was \\ndesigned primarily to assess the cardiac safety of pertuzumab in different neoadju-\\nvant regimens. Patients were randomly allocated to receive one of three neoadjuvant \\nregimens prior to surgery: three cycles of FEC followed by three cycles of docetaxel, \\nall in combination with pertuzumab and trastuzumab (A); three cycles of FEC alone \\nfollowed by three cycles of docetaxel and trastuzumab in combination with pertu-\\nzumab (B); or six cycles of docetaxel, carboplatin, and trastuzumab (TCH) in com-\\nbination with pertuzumab (C). Following surgery, all patients received trastuzumab \\nintravenously every 3\\xa0weeks to complete 1\\xa0year of therapy. The results suggest that \\nall three arms achieved >55% pCR. During post-treatment follow-up, 2.8%, 4.0% \\nand 5.4% patients in groups A-C had any-grade left ventricular systolic dysfunction; \\n11.1%, 16.0% and 11.8% patients experienced left ventricular ejection fraction \\ndeclines ≥10% from baseline to <50. Currently, there are insufficient cardiac safety \\ndata to recommend concomitant administration of an anthracycline with pertu-\\nzumab and trastuzumab.\\nThe I-SPY 2 trial (NCT01042379) is an ongoing multi drug, multicenter neoad-\\njuvant phase II breast cancer trial to determine whether adding experimental agents \\nto standard neoadjuvant medications increases the probability of pCR compared to \\nstandard neoadjuvant chemotherapy for each biomarker signature established at \\ntrial entry. A variety of agents are being investigated, both in combination with \\ntrastuzumab and alone, including T-DM1, pertuzumab, neratinib, pembrolizumab \\nas well as AKT inhibitors. The findings reported at the San Antonio Breast Cancer \\nSymposium included positive results for the PARP inhibitor veliparib, the first drug \\nto complete testing in the trial. Although the estimated pCR rate for patients with \\ntriple-negative breast cancer was 52% after receipt of chemotherapy plus veliparib/\\ncarboplatin and standard paclitaxel followed by anthracycline-based chemotherapy \\nvs 26% with control chemotherapy alone, in “signatures” other than triple-negative \\nbreast cancer, the combination was predicted to be far less successful. For the hor-\\nmone receptor-positive/HER2-negative group, the estimated pathologic complete \\nresponse rate was 14% for the combination and 19% for controls. The pCR rates for \\nHER2+ group have not been reported yet.\\nThe GeparSixto [44] study evaluated the benefit of adding carboplatin to pacli-\\ntaxel plus pegylated liposomal doxorubicin given as a weekly regimen for 18\\xa0weeks \\nto 595 patients. Added to this backbone were three targeted agents corresponding to \\ntumor subtype: trastuzumab and lapatinib for HER2-positive patients and bevaci-\\n16 Adjuvant Therapy for\\xa0HER2-Positive Early-Stage Breast Cancer 399\\nzumab (Avastin) for triple-negative patients. Investigators compared the rates of \\npCR between paclitaxel/doxorubicin and paclitaxel/doxorubicin/carboplatin. \\nThe\\xa0addition of carboplatin significantly increased the pathologic complete response \\nrate, which was 37.2% in the control arm and 46.7% in the carboplatin arm (P\\xa0<\\xa00.2) \\nfor patients with triple-negative breast cancer. However, the HER2-positive sub-\\ngroup did not benefit. Among HER2-positive patients, pathologic complete \\nresponses were achieved by 36.8% and 32.8% in the control arm and the carboplatin \\narm, respectively (P\\xa0=\\xa00.581; test for interaction P\\xa0=\\xa00.015).\\n Optimizing Therapy for\\xa0Hormone Receptor–Coexpressing Disease\\nAt least half of HER2-positive breast cancer coexpresses one or both hormone \\nreceptors, and this coexpression may serve as a pathway for resistance to HER2- \\ntargeted therapy. However, HER2-targeted therapy is not necessarily inactive in \\nhormone receptor-positive breast cancer. In fact, analyses from the AC/trastuzumab \\nand AC/T arms of the BCIRG-00651 and B-3153 trials have shown that the HRs for \\nDFS are very similar for hormone receptor-positive (HR, 0.65 and 0.61 for \\nBCIRG- 006 and B-31, respectively) and hormone receptor-negative (HR, 0.64 and \\n0.62 for BCIRG-006 and B-31, respectively) disease. This also holds true for \\nOS.\\xa0Subset analysis of the HERA study at 11\\xa0years of follow-up also demonstrated \\nlong-term trastuzumab benefit for all patients, regardless of HR status [45]. Although \\ntrastuzumab imparts DFS and OS benefit, regardless of hormone receptor status, the \\npresence of ER may indicate more indolent, luminal-like tumor behavior. For exam-\\nple, Kaplan–Meier curves from HERA indicate that although the long-term risk of \\nrecurrence is similar in hormone receptor-positive and hormone receptor-negative \\nsubtypes, patients with hormone receptor-negative disease have earlier recurrences, \\nwhich is consistent with a more aggressive disease biology. Further evidence sup-\\nporting the notion that disease behavior differs based on hormone receptor expres-\\nsion comes from neoadjuvant clinical trials, which have consistently shown that \\npCR rates are lower for hormone receptor-positive, HER2-positive breast cancer \\nthan for hormone receptor-negative disease [40, 41, 46, 47]. However, the longer \\nfollow-up of the NeoSphere trial indicates that patients with hormone receptor \\ncoexpression have numerically higher PFS than those with tumors lacking hormone \\nreceptors (5-year PFS for patients who achieved pCR: 90% if hormone receptor \\npositive, 84% if hormone receptor negative; 5-year PFS for patients who did not \\nachieve pCR: 80% if hormone receptor positive, 72% if hormone receptor negative). \\nThus, patients with hormone receptor-positive tumors may do better in the long run. \\nIntriguing biomarker analyses from HERA suggest that although ER-positive \\ntumors with a high level of HER2 amplification (by FISH ratio) derive clear benefit \\nfrom trastuzumab, those with a low level of HER2 amplification may not receive \\nbenefit from trastuzumab-based therapy [48].\\nSeveral clinical trials aiming to evaluate co-targeting of hormone receptor and \\nHER2 have been conducted. The first of these, TBCRC-006, evaluated 12\\xa0weeks of \\nneoadjuvant lapatinib plus trastuzumab (with letrozole for ER-positive tumors) \\n400 S. Bayraktar and A. Aydiner\\n[49]. pCR (breast) for HER2-positive/hormone receptor-positive tumors was 21% \\nin this proof-of-concept study, indicating that a relatively well-tolerated \\nchemotherapy- free regimen might be highly effective for patients if accurate bio-\\nmarkers for selection can be identified.\\nTrastuzumab emtansine has also been evaluated in the neoadjuvant and adjuvant \\nsettings. The WGS-ADAPT study compared four cycles of T-DM1, either alone or \\nin combination with endocrine therapy, to trastuzumab plus endocrine therapy for \\nhormone receptor-positive, HER2-positive patients [50]. This relatively short course \\nof T-DM1 was associated with an impressive pCR rate (breast and lymph nodes) of \\n41%, which was considerably higher than that achieved with trastuzumab plus \\nendocrine therapy.\\nAlthough neither of these relatively small studies has changed the standard of \\ncare, the intriguing results should encourage the investigation of whether similar, \\nless-toxic regimens might be beneficial for selected patient populations.\\nIn December 2016, the results of the NSABP B-52 trial were presented. This \\nstudy was designed to evaluate whether the addition of an aromatase inhibitor to \\nstandard chemotherapy plus HER2-targeted therapy (TCHP) would improve pCR \\nrates for hormone receptor-positive/HER2-positive breast cancer and to test whether \\nendocrine therapy is antagonistic in combination with chemotherapy [51]. Although \\nthe addition of endocrine therapy to TCHP did not lead to a statistically notable \\nimprovement in pCR (41% for TCHP vs. 46% for TCHP plus endocrine therapy), it \\ndid not appear to be antagonistic, leaving room for future studies to test less toxic \\nchemotherapy regimens concurrently with hormone therapy approaches.\\nIn summary, in just over a decade, the management of early-stage HER2-\\npositive breast cancer has changed drastically because of the development of \\nhighly effective biologically targeted therapies. The therapeutic options available \\nto the patient in both the neoadjuvant and adjuvant settings are now nearly count-\\nless, making the choice of optimal therapy somewhat difficult at times. Our pur-\\nsuit to provide patients with the safest and most effective therapies for their \\nparticular disease requires us to design carefully selected clinical trials with atten-\\ntion toward the discovery of molecular drivers of disease biology and markers of \\nresponse to therapy.\\n Resistance to\\xa0Trastuzumab and\\xa0Lapatinib\\nAlthough HER2-targeted therapies have had a significant impact on patient out-\\ncomes, resistance to these agents is common. In clinical trials, 74% of patients with \\nHER2+ metastatic breast cancer did not have a tumor response to first-line trastu-\\nzumab monotherapy [52], and 50% did not respond to trastuzumab in combination \\nwith chemotherapy [6]. These examples illustrate the problem that inherent (de \\nnovo) resistance to HER2-targeted agents poses for the effective treatment of \\nHER2+ BC.\\xa0 Moreover, only approximately one quarter of patients with HER2+ \\nmetastatic breast cancer who were previously treated with trastuzumab achieved a \\nresponse with lapatinib plus capecitabine [8]. These limitations have led to efforts \\n16 Adjuvant Therapy for\\xa0HER2-Positive Early-Stage Breast Cancer 401\\nto better understand the molecular determinants of resistance to these agents to \\nimprove the selection of patients who are most likely to benefit from specific thera-\\npies and to develop new agents that can overcome resistance. Here, we discuss new \\nstrategies that are mostly being investigated in metastatic breast cancer, although \\nsome are being studied in adjuvant and neoadjuvant settings.\\n Afatinib\\nAfatinib is an oral small molecule that irreversibly inhibits HER-1, 2 and 4 [53]. In \\na phase II study, 4 of 35 patients with trastuzumab-resistant metastatic breast cancer \\nshowed partial responses [53]. Adverse events included diarrhea and rash. However, \\nthe recently published LUX-Breast 1 [54] trial was a negative trial for afatinib. This \\nwas a phase III study comparing vinorelbine plus trastuzumab or afatinib plus \\nvinorelbine for metastatic patients who progressed to one chemotherapy regimen \\ncontaining trastuzumab. Recruitment was stopped on April 26, 2013, after a benefit- \\nrisk assessment by the independent data monitoring committee was unfavorable for \\nthe afatinib group. Patients on afatinib plus vinorelbine had to switch to trastu-\\nzumab plus vinorelbine.\\n Neratinib\\nNeratinib is also an oral, irreversible inhibitor of HER-1,-2 and -4 [55]. A phase II \\ntrial evaluated neratinib in 136 HER-2-positive patients [55]. The median PFS was \\n22.3 and 39.6\\xa0weeks and the overall response rate (ORR) was 24% and 56% in pre-\\ntreated and trastuzumab-naïve patients, respectively. Diarrhea was the most com-\\nmon grade 3/4 adverse effect. Another phase I–II trial combined neratinib plus \\ntrastuzumab in 45 metastatic, and trastuzumab-resistant patients showed an encour-\\naging 27% ORR [56]. Finally, a phase I–II trial evaluated neratinib plus vinorelbine \\nin trastuzumab- or lapatinib-pretreated patients (n\\xa0=\\xa077) [57]. ORR was 41% (no \\nprior lapatinib) and 8% (prior lapatinib). A phase III trial (ExteNET) in the adjuvant \\nsetting is ongoing (NCT00878709) (Table\\xa016.2).\\n MM-111\\nMM-11 is a bi-specific monoclonal antibody that reversibly targets the HER-2 and \\n-3 heterodimer. A phase I–II study is currently evaluating its efficacy as a single \\nagent in HER-2-positive advanced breast cancer patients who have received prior \\ntrastuzumab or lapatinib therapy (clinicaltrials.gov, NCT00911898). Another phase \\nI trial is studying MM-111 plus trastuzumab in HER2-positive, heregulin-positive, \\nadvanced and refractory breast cancer (clinicaltrials.gov, NCT01097460).\\n402 S. Bayraktar and A. Aydiner\\n Trastuzumab Deruxtecan\\nTrastuzumab deruxtecan (ds-8201a), a HER2-targeting antibody-drug conjugate, \\ndemonstrated significant clinical activity in heavily pretreated patients with HER2- \\nexpressing metastatic breast cancers who previously received ado-trastuzumab \\nemtansine (T-DM1; Kadcyla). Whereas T-DM1 is a tubulin-targeting chemother-\\napy, trastuzumab deruxtecan is a topoisomerase 1 inhibitor. It is highly potent, with \\na drug-to-antibody ratio of 7.8, compared with 3.5 for T-DM1.\\nIn an ongoing 2-part phase I study, the ORR to trastuzumab deruxtecan in 57 \\nevaluable patients with HER2-positive tumors was 61.4%. In the HER2-positive \\ncohort, the ORR was 56.4% (22 of 39) among those with ER-positive disease and \\n75.0% (12 of 16) among those with ER-negative disease. Notably, the ORR was \\n62.5% among the 50 patients in this cohort who had received prior pertuzumab \\ntreatment. The disease control rate (DCR) was 94.7% overall in the HER2-positive \\nsubset: 92.3% in the ER-positive group, 100.0% in the ER-negative group, and \\n94.0% among those who had received prior pertuzumab. Median PFS was not \\nreached in the ER-positive group and was 10.3\\xa0months in the ER-negative group. \\nMedian PFS was 10.3\\xa0months in the HER2-positive cohort who had received prior \\npertuzumab, as reported by Shanu Modi, MD, at the 2017 San Antonio Breast \\nCancer Symposium. The main toxicity was grade 1/2 gastrointestinal toxicity. \\nGrade 1/2 nausea was reported by 67.9%. Grade 3 and 4 events were hematological \\nin nature. The rates of grade 3/4 anemia were 8.7% in the HER2-positive group and \\n0.9% in the HER2-low group. The rates of grade 3 decreases in neutrophil count and \\nwhite blood cell count were each 10.4%. Across the study, 5 patients (4.3%) had a \\ngrade 4 decrease in neutrophil count.\\nIn August 2017, trastuzumab deruxtecan received FDA breakthrough therapy \\ndesignation for the treatment of patients with HER2-positive, locally advanced, or \\nmetastatic breast cancer who have been treated with trastuzumab and pertuzumab \\nand have disease progression after T-DM1. An ongoing pivotal phase II trial called \\nDESTINY-Breast01 is examining the efficacy and safety of trastuzumab deruxtecan \\nin patients with HER2-positive unresectable and/or metastatic breast cancer who \\nare resistant or refractory to T-DM1.\\n HER2-Targeted Vaccines\\nCancer vaccines designed to induce specific anti-HER-2 immunity are being inves-\\ntigated. Different strategies include protein-based vaccines, plasmid DNA-based \\nvaccines, and vaccines that deliver HER-2\\xa0in a viral vector. HER-2 peptide-based \\nvaccines have been tested in patients with metastatic HER-2-positive breast cancer \\n[58]. Immunized patients developed delayed-type hypersensitivity reactions and \\nstrong CD8+ cell responses specific for HER-2 [59]. A dendritic cell-based vaccine \\nwas also tested in a small group of patients with stage IV breast cancer [60]. One \\npatient showed a partial response, and three had stable disease for ≥12\\xa0 months. \\n16 Adjuvant Therapy for\\xa0HER2-Positive Early-Stage Breast Cancer 403\\nUsing a different strategy, cell-based GM-CSF secreting vaccines were tested in \\ncombination with trastuzumab [61].\\n Other Exploratory Anti-HER-2 Blocking Strategies\\nOngoing trials combining anti-HER-2 agents with drugs blocking other signaling \\npathways hold the promise of further improvement. An auspicious approach is the \\ncombination of anti-HER-2 therapy with insulin growth factor receptor (IGFR-1)-\\nblocking agents. IGFR-1 inhibition has been shown to restore sensitivity to trastu-\\nzumab in animal models [62]. Another potential combination is dual blockade of \\nHER-2 and SRC, which was recently shown to work at a central node downstream \\nof multiple trastuzumab-resistance mechanisms [63]. Finally, HER-3 is another \\nstrong activator of PI3K/Akt signaling pathway that has been demonstrated to be \\nup-regulated after HER-2 blockade [64]. Although still in early phases of develop-\\nment, Rb disruption strategies and the use of CDK-4/6 inhibitors may be clinically \\nuseful [65]. Future studies of HER2-positive patients will be challenging because of \\nthe small window to improve outcome beyond what is achievable today.\\n Conclusion\\nThe current available evidence supports the use of anti-HER2 drugs as a neoadju-\\nvant treatment, and in terms of selecting the appropriate chemotherapy regimen, a \\ncouple of important points should be emphasized. First, dual blockade of the HER-2 \\nreceptor, even without chemotherapy, results in an at least 15% pCR (NeoSphere \\nTrial), which suggests that 1\\xa0 in 6 patients may not need chemotherapy. This cer-\\ntainly represents an attractive option for patients who cannot tolerate more than \\ntargeted agents. Second, the addition of chemotherapy leads to a more robust effect, \\nwith values of 40–50% when trastuzumab alone is used and >50% when dual block-\\nade is applied. Moreover, anthracyclines appear to play a significant role in HER2- \\npositive tumors; however, the results from the NeoALTTO and TRYPHAENA trials \\nsuggest that when dual blockade is used, anthracycline toxicity might be spared. \\nThird, in all clinical trials available, pCR is markedly diminished in tumors express-\\ning hormone receptors in addition to HER2. Finally, there is a need for predictors of \\nwhich patients will most benefit from trastuzumab-containing therapies. Few mark-\\ners are known, and confusion about some markers has emerged. For instance, p95, \\na truncated HER2 protein that had been associated with resistance to trastuzumab, \\nwas unexpectedly linked to a stronger response to the drug when tested in the \\nGeparQuattro study [66].\\nMost likely, the most important question is how reliable is pCR as a valid surro-\\ngate for DFS and OS.\\xa0A meta-analysis with 12900 patients enrolled in randomized \\nneoadjuvant trials showed the strongest correlation between pCR and event-free \\n404 S. Bayraktar and A. Aydiner\\nsurvival (EFS) in patients with triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) (EFS: HR \\n0.24, 95% CI: 0.18–0.33; OS: 0.16, 0.11–0.25) and in those with HER2-positive, \\nhormone-receptor-negative tumors who received trastuzumab (EFS: 0.15, 0.09–\\n0.27; OS: 0.08, 0.03, 0.22) [47]. Based on the phase III APHINITYdata, ASCO \\nupdated their recommendations in 2018 stating that 1 year of pertuzumab may be \\noffered in addition to trastuzumab and combination chemotherapy for patients with \\nhigh-risk, early-stage breast cancer, such as those with node-positive disease. \\nImportantly, there are no data to guide the duration of pertuzumab treatment in \\npatients who received neoadjuvant pertuzumab and achieved a pathologic complete \\nresponse [67]. Neoadjuvant treatment with anti-HER-2 agents remains a valid and \\napproved option, especially in those patients with locally advanced, unresectable \\ntumors. Its use in small resectable cancer is probably appropriate but must be bal-\\nanced with practical considerations and the patient’s own preferences.\\n Adjuvant/Neoadjuvant Regimens in\\xa0HER2-Positive Breast \\nCancer\\nAC followed by paclitaxel\\xa0+\\xa0trastuzumab\\nDoxorubicin 60\\xa0mg/m2 IV day 1,\\nCyclophosphamide 600\\xa0mg/m2 IV day 1,\\nCycled every 21\\xa0days for 4 cycles.\\nFollowed by:\\nPaclitaxel 80\\xa0mg/m2 day 1, 1\\xa0h IV infusion weekly for 12\\xa0weeks.\\nWith*:\\nTrastuzumab 8\\xa0mg/kg IV with first dose of paclitaxel\\nFollowed by:\\nTrastuzumab 6\\xa0mg/kg IV every 21\\xa0days to complete 1\\xa0year of treatment.\\n*Evaluate left ventricular ejection fraction prior to and every 3\\xa0 months during \\ntreatment.\\nDose dense AC (doxorubicin/cyclophosphamide) followed by paclitaxel trastuzumab\\nDoxorubicin 60\\xa0mg/m2 IV day 1,\\nCyclophosphamide 600\\xa0mg/m2 IV day 1,\\nCycled every 14\\xa0days for 4 cycles, all cycles are with GCSF support.\\nFollowed by:\\nPaclitaxel 175\\xa0mg/m2 day 1, 3\\xa0h IV infusion,\\nCycled every 14\\xa0days for 4 cycles, all cycles are with GCSF support.\\nWith*:\\nTrastuzumab 4\\xa0mg/kg IV with first dose of paclitaxel\\nFollowed by:\\nTrastuzumab 2\\xa0mg/kg IV weekly to complete 1\\xa0year of treatment.\\nAs an alternative, trastuzumab 6\\xa0mg/kg IV every 21\\xa0days may be used following the \\ncompletion of paclitaxel, and given to complete 1\\xa0 year of trastuzumab \\ntreatment.\\n16 Adjuvant Therapy for\\xa0HER2-Positive Early-Stage Breast Cancer 405\\n*Evaluate left ventricular ejection fraction prior to and every 3\\xa0 months during \\ntreatment.\\nAC (doxorubicin/cyclophosphamide) followed by weekly paclitaxel + trastuzumab \\n+\\xa0pertuzumab\\nDoxorubicin 60\\xa0mg/m2 IV day 1,\\nCyclophosphamide 600\\xa0mg/m2 IV day 1,\\nCycled every 21\\xa0days for 4 cycles.\\nFollowed by*:\\nPertuzumab 840\\xa0mg IV day 1 followed by 420\\xa0mg IV, every 21\\xa0days to complete \\n1\\xa0year of treatment,\\nTrastuzumab 8\\xa0mg/kg day 1 followed by 6\\xa0mg/kg IV, every 21\\xa0days to complete \\n1\\xa0year of treatment,\\nPaclitaxel 80\\xa0mg /m2 day 1, 1\\xa0h IV infusion weekly for 12\\xa0weeks.\\n*Evaluate left ventricular ejection fraction prior to and every 3\\xa0 months during \\ntreatment.\\nTCH (Docetaxel\\xa0+\\xa0carboplatin\\xa0+\\xa0trastuzumab)\\nDocetaxel 75\\xa0mg/m2 IV day 1,\\nCarboplatin AUC 6 IV day 1,\\nCycled every 21\\xa0days for 6 cycles.\\nTrastuzumab 4\\xa0mg/kg IV week 1\\nFollowed by*:\\nTrastuzumab 2\\xa0mg/kg IV weekly for 17\\xa0weeks.\\nFollowed by:\\nTrastuzumab 6\\xa0mg/kg IV cycled every 21\\xa0days to complete 1\\xa0year of trastuzumab \\ntreatment.\\nOR\\nTrastuzumab 8\\xa0mg/kg IV week 1\\nFollowed by:\\nTrastuzumab 6\\xa0mg/kg IV cycled every 21\\xa0days to complete 1\\xa0year of trastuzumab \\ntreatment.\\n*Evaluate left ventricular ejection fraction prior to and every 3\\xa0 months during \\ntreatment.\\nTCH (Docetaxel\\xa0+\\xa0carboplatin\\xa0+\\xa0trastuzumab)\\xa0+\\xa0pertuzumab\\nDocetaxel 75\\xa0mg/m2 IV day 1,\\nCarboplatin AUC 6 IV day 1,\\nCycled every 21\\xa0days for 6 cycles.\\nAND*\\nPertuzumab 840\\xa0mg IV day 1\\nTrastuzumab 8\\xa0mg/kg IV day 1\\nFollowed by:\\nTrastuzumab 6\\xa0mg/kg IV day 1\\nPertuzumab 420\\xa0mg IV day 1\\nCycled every 21\\xa0days to complete 1\\xa0year of therapy.\\n406 S.

Patients with estrogen receptor (ER)- \\nand/or progesterone receptor (PR)-positive invasive breast cancers should be con-\\nsidered for adjuvant endocrine therapy, regardless of age, lymph node status, or \\nadjuvant chemotherapy use. Adjuvant hormonal manipulation is achieved by block-\\ning the ER in breast tumor tissues with tamoxifen in premenopausal and postmeno-\\npausal women, lowering systemic estrogen levels with luteinizing hormone-releasing \\nhormone agonists in premenopausal women, or blocking estrogen biosynthesis in \\nnon-ovarian tissues with aromatase inhibitors in postmenopausal women. Features \\nindicative of uncertain endocrine responsiveness include low levels of hormone \\nreceptor immunoreactivity, PR negativity, poor differentiation (grade 3), high Ki67 \\nindex, human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 overexpression, and high gene \\nrecurrence score (Figs.\\xa017.1, 17.2, 17.3, 17.4, and 17.5).\\nI.

Among early-stage breast cancer patients, approximately 60% require \\nadjuvant ET after chemotherapy (CT), 20% require only ET, and 20% require only \\nCT.\\xa0ER-positive breast cancer is frequently associated with an older age and lower \\nhistological grade.\\nThe current ETs modulate or disrupt estrogen production or ER function/expres-\\nsion in breast cancer cells. In premenopausal women, the ovarian follicles are the \\nmain source of estrogen production. Estrogen production by the ovary is regulated \\nby the anterior pituitary gland, which produces luteinizing hormone (LH) and \\nfollicle-s timulating hormone (FSH). LH acts on thecal cells to stimulate androgen \\nsynthesis, whereas FSH acts upon granulosa cells to stimulate production of the \\nenzyme aromatase, which converts testosterone and androstenedione to estradiol \\n(E2) and estrone, respectively, through aromatization. Pituitary LH and FSH produc-\\ntion are, in turn, regulated by LH-releasing hormone (LHRH) (also known as \\nsystemic treatment administration. In the 8th version of the American Joint Commission of Cancer \\n(AJCC) for breast cancer, prognostic gene signatures will be integrated into the staging scheme as \\nprognostic staging: For patients with hormone receptor-positive, HER2-negative, and lymph node- \\nnegative tumors, prognostic gene signatures (Oncotype DX) with a low risk score regardless of T \\nsize place the tumor in the same prognostic category as T1a–T1b N0 M0, and the tumor is staged \\nusing the AJCC prognostic stage group table as stage I.\\xa0Based on multigene signature tests, che-\\nmotherapy may be omitted for patients with Luminal B-like (HER2 negative) disease with a low \\nOncotype Dx® score, MammaPrint® low-risk status, low PAM50 ROR score, or EndoPredict® \\nlow-risk status. In the TAILORx ClinicalTrial (ASCO Congress 2018), adjuvant endocrine therapy \\nand chemoendocrine therapy had similar efficacy in women with hormone-receptor-positive, \\nHER2-negative, axillary node-negative breast cancer who had a midrange 21-gene recurrence \\nscore (RS 11–25). However, the chemotherapy benefit for invasive disease-free survival varied \\nwith the combination of recurrence score and age (P\\xa0=\\xa00.004), with some benefit of chemotherapy \\nfound in women 50\\xa0years of age or younger with a recurrence score of 16–25. The situations in \\nwhich multigene tests may be particularly helpful can be summarized as follows: tumor size \\nbetween 1 and 3\\xa0cm and ER/PR positive and HER2 negative and node negative or Nmi and Grade \\n2 and Ki-67 between 15% and 35%. In hormone receptor-positive T1c N0 (1–2\\xa0cm) tumors, grade \\n3 disease with a high Ki-67 value (e.g., above 35%) and PgR <20% may be considered adequate \\nfor chemotherapy indication. In cases where multigene tests cannot be performed, the risk factors \\ncan be determined using web-based formulas, and an indication for chemotherapy administration \\ncan be established. aThere is no absolute age limit. Rather, treatment depends on the disease, the \\npresence of comorbidities, the patient’s life expectancy, and patient preferences. Treatment should \\nbe individualized for patients >70\\xa0years of age. b Chemotherapy and endocrine therapy as adjuvant \\ntherapy should be given sequentially, with endocrine therapy following chemotherapy. The avail-\\nable data suggest that sequential or concurrent endocrine therapy with radiation therapy is accept-\\nable. cFertility preservation (e.g., by ovarian tissue or oocyte conservation) should be offered to \\nwomen <40\\xa0years of age. Ovarian function suppression with LHRHa during chemotherapy should \\nbe offered for HR-negative disease. dConsider adjuvant bisphosphonate therapy in postmenopausal \\n(natural or induced) patients receiving adjuvant therapy. eEvaluate for multi-gene signature test, \\nespecially for Luminal B-like, high Ki67, or grade III tumors\\n416 I.

In patients over 70\\xa0years of age, treatment should be individualized. bThe following \\nfactors are indications for including ovarian function suppression (OFS): age ≤35\\xa0years, premeno-\\npausal estrogen level following adjuvant chemotherapy, grade 3 disease, involvement of 4 or more \\nnodes, and adverse multigene test results. The ASCO Guideline recommends OFS in premeno-\\npausal patients with stage II and III disease who have chemotherapy indications; however, this is \\nnot recommended for stage I disease. The optimal OFS duration is 5\\xa0years. cIn high-risk premeno-\\npausal women, ‘LHRH-agonist\\xa0+\\xa0aromatase inhibitor’ may be the preferred adjuvant endocrine \\ntherapy. The following factors are indications for the use of OFS plus an aromatase inhibitor (AI) \\nrather than OFS plus tamoxifen: age ≤35\\xa0years, grade 3 disease, involvement of 4 or more nodes, \\nand adverse multigene test results. dIn patients with Luminal A-like tumors and 1–3 positive lymph \\nnodes (with the evaluation of other factors such as grade, age, or multigene signature test results), \\n“adjuvant endocrine therapy alone” may be an option. eSome patients may be adequately treated \\nwith tamoxifen alone.

In \\npostmenopausal women, estrogen production is dependent on peripheral \\n aromatization, predominantly in the liver, adrenal glands, and adipose tissue.

Given their \\ndifferent modes of action, menopausal status is important in ET selection.\\nERs belong to a family of nuclear steroid receptors that includes thyroid hor-\\nmone, vitamin D, and retinoids. ER phosphorylation upon estrogen binding induces \\na conformational change, resulting in receptor dimerization [1]. The receptor com-\\nplex binds to specific estrogen response elements in target gene promoters, resulting \\nin the up-regulation of target gene expression [1]. Two ERs, ERα and ERβ, have \\nbeen described [2]. ERβ is broadly expressed in a variety of tissues, whereas ERα \\nhas a more restricted expression pattern (breast, ovary, uterus, and endometrium). \\nThe function and role of ERβ in breast cancer are not yet clear, so ER generally \\nThe following factors support the inclusion of an AI at some point: lymph node involvement, grade \\n3 disease, high Ki67 proliferation index, or HER2 positivity. If an AI is used, it should be started \\nupfront in patients at higher risk. The upfront AI can be switched to tamoxifen after 2\\xa0years in \\nselected patients (e.g., those experiencing side effects of the AI). fAfter 5\\xa0years of adjuvant tamoxi-\\nfen, continued AI (for postmenopausal estrogen levels at baseline or postmenopausal patients with \\npremenopausal estrogen levels at baseline) or tamoxifen (for premenopausal or postmenopausal \\npatients) for up to 10\\xa0years should be recommended to patients with node-positive disease, grade \\n3 disease, or high Ki-67. gAfter 5\\xa0years of adjuvant therapy involving a switch from tamoxifen to \\nan AI (therefore assuming postmenopausal status at the 5-year time point and reasonable tolerance \\nto endocrine therapy), patients may continue AI therapy for a cumulative total of 5\\xa0years. hAfter 5 \\nyears of continuous AI adjuvant therapy, we do not (yet) know whether to provide 3–5\\xa0years of \\ntamoxifen, 3–5\\xa0years of AI, or no further endocrine treatment. AI can be considered for an addi-\\ntional 5\\xa0years. However, a randomized clinical trial failed to show a difference in survival between \\n2 and 5\\xa0 years’ use of additional AI. (San Antonio BCS, 2017). iThe optimal OFS duration is \\n5\\xa0years. jThe Luminal A phenotype is less responsive to chemotherapy. In node-negative disease, \\nchemotherapy should not be added based on the T size. A combination of the biological properties \\nof the tumor (such as Ki67, LVI, grade, and multigene signature) must be used to assess whether \\nto provide chemotherapy. kBased on immunohistochemistry (IHC), in Luminal B-like (HER2-\\nnegative) tumors, chemotherapy may be omitted in some low-risk patients (based on combinations \\nof certain prognostic factors such as low tumor mass, low grade, low Ki67, an absence of LVI, and \\nolder age). lBased on multigene signature tests, chemotherapy may be omitted for patients with \\nLuminal B-like (HER2-negative) disease with a low Oncotype Dx® score, MammaPrint® low-risk \\nstatus, low PAM50 ROR score or EndoPredict® low-risk status.

In high-risk postmenopausal \\npatients, aromatase inhibitors (AIs) may be preferred over tamoxifen. The following factors argue \\nfor the inclusion of an AI at some point: lymph node involvement, grade 3 disease, high Ki67 \\nproliferation index, or HER2 positivity. If an AI is used, it should be started upfront in patients at \\nhigher risk. The upfront AI can be switched to tamoxifen after 2\\xa0years in selected patients (e.g., \\nthose experiencing side effects of the AI). cAfter 5\\xa0years of adjuvant tamoxifen, continued AI or \\ntamoxifen (for patients with intolerance to AI therapy) for up to 10\\xa0years should be recommended \\nto patients with node-positive disease, grade 3 disease, or high Ki-67. dAfter 5\\xa0years of adjuvant \\ntherapy involving a switch from tamoxifen to an AI (therefore assuming postmenopausal status at \\nthe 5-year time point and reasonable tolerance to endocrine therapy), patients may continue AI \\ntherapy for a cumulative total of 5\\xa0years. This subject requires clarification. eAfter 5\\xa0years of con-\\ntinuous AI adjuvant therapy, extension of treatment with an aromatase inhibitor may be recom-\\nmended for 3–5\\xa0years. In a randomized study, no difference between the 2- and 5-year survival was \\nobserved (San Antonio BCS, 2017). In patients with moderate to high risk, adjuvant endocrine \\ntreatment should be increased to 10\\xa0years (in patients with stage II and III disease); this increase is \\nnot recommended for stage I patients. fThe definition of menopause is important and can include \\nnatural menopause (no menses for 12 months before starting chemotherapy or hormone therapy) \\nor menopause with ovarian ablation or suppression. Luteinizing hormone (LH), follicle-s timulating \\nhormone (FSH), and serum estradiol (E2) levels should be at postmenopausal levels and should be \\nmeasured before systemic treatment unless oophorectomy has been performed with hysterectomy \\nin women aged 60\\xa0years or younger (Box 17.1). gConsider adjuvant bisphosphonate therapy in \\npostmenopausal (natural or induced) patients receiving adjuvant therapy\\n420 I. Yildiz and A. Aydiner\\nrefers to ERα. The ER exerts both genomic and nongenomic effects in breast cancer. \\nIts genomic effects include the transcriptional activation of specific genes important \\nfor tumor cell growth and survival, whereas its nongenomic effects include the acti-\\nvation of growth factor pathways, such as human epidermal growth factor receptor-\\n 2 (HER2) and insulin-like growth factor receptor that enhance tumor growth. \\nGrowth factor receptor-linked kinases further activate the ER and its coactivators to \\naugment ER-mediated transcriptional activity. This bidirectional crosstalk can \\ncause ET resistance [3].\\nHR status is currently determined based on the immunohistochemical (IHC) \\nexpression of ER and PR.\\xa0Tumors with any detectable (≥1%) ER and/or PR expres-\\nsion are considered HR-positive. ER expression correlates with slower tumor \\ngrowth, better differentiation, and longer natural history. By contrast, the absence of \\nboth ER and PR expression is associated with poorer prognosis and a reduced over-\\nall survival (OS) rate. Patients with ER- and/or PR-positive invasive breast cancers \\nshould be considered for adjuvant ET, regardless of age, lymph node status, or adju-\\nvant CT use [4]. Endocrine-responsive breast cancer is a heterogeneous disease with \\na wide spectrum of clinical, pathological, and molecular features. There is no single \\nmarker that can identify the optimal ET to be used in a given patient. Although \\nmolecular typing is an ideal method for assessing recurrence risk and treatment \\nresponse, routine genetic profiling has not yet been established in clinical practice. \\nIHC typing is still considered the state of the art for assessing the risk of relapse and \\npotential benefit of specific therapies. Features indicative of uncertain endocrine \\nresponsiveness include low levels of HR immunoreactivity, PR negativity, poor dif-\\nferentiation (grade 3), high proliferation index (Ki67), HER2 overexpression, and \\nhigh gene recurrence score [5]. Patients with tumors of uncertain endocrine respon-\\nsiveness are usually treated with a combination of ET and CT.\\xa0The benefit of adju-\\nvant endocrine therapy is very small in patients with hormone receptor-positive \\ndisease and those who have lymph node-negative cancers ≤0.5\\xa0cm or 0.6–1.0\\xa0cm in \\ndiameter with favorable prognostic features.\\nGene expression profiling has shed light on the complex molecular background \\nof this disease and holds the potential for more accurate prognostication and patient \\nstratification for therapy [6–8]. A list of intrinsic genes is used to differentiate sub-\\ntypes and includes ER, HER2, and proliferation-related genes as well as a unique \\ncluster of genes called the basal cluster. The molecular subtypes include the follow-\\ning: (1) the luminal subtype (luminal A and B), which expresses genes associated \\nwith luminal epithelial cells of normal breast tissue and overlaps with ER-positive \\nbreast cancers as defined by clinical assays; (2) the HER2-enriched subtype, which \\nrepresents the majority of clinically HER2-positive breast cancers; and (3) the \\nER-negative subtype, which expresses low levels of HR-related genes.\\nSeveral genomic tests have been developed with the aim of improving prognostic \\ninformation beyond that provided by classic clinicopathological parameters [6–8]. \\nSome of these tests are currently available in the clinic and are used to determine \\nprognosis and, more importantly, to assist in determining the need for adjuvant che-\\nmotherapy, particularly in patients with ER-positive disease. The available data sug-\\ngest that information generated from genomic tests has resulted in a change in \\n17 Adjuvant Endocrine Therapy for\\xa0Breast Cancer 421\\ndecision making in approximately 25–30% of cases. Molecular signatures, such as \\nthe 21-gene recurrence score (RS; Oncotype DX®) [9], Amsterdam 70-gene prog-\\nnostic profile (MammaPrint®) [10], and Rotterdam/Veridex 76-gene signature [11], \\nincrease the prognostic value of conventional indicators in predicting breast cancer \\noutcomes and treatment response. Oncotype DX is the most widely used of these \\nassays. Oncotype DX can be performed using formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded \\ntissue, whereas the other tests require fresh or frozen tissue. The predictive value of \\nOncotype DX has been validated in both premenopausal and postmenopausal \\nwomen, and its use in node-negative, ER-positive breast cancer patients is sug-\\ngested in the American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) guidelines.\\nMenopausal status is generally assessed using clinical features such as age, men-\\nstrual history, and menopausal symptoms and may be confirmed by the presence of \\nserum FSH and E2 levels within menopausal range. Elevated FSH and reduced E2 \\nlevels generally confirm the clinical diagnosis of menopause. However, the use of \\nthese biomarkers has several limitations. The transition toward menopause is highly \\nvariable, thus making it difficult to define diagnostic cutoff values for FSH/E2. \\nTherefore, single-time-point testing of FSH/E2 levels is insufficient to confirm \\nmenopause. Furthermore, FSH/estrogen levels are influenced by ETs. Tamoxifen \\nhas been reported to increase circulating estrogens and decrease the FSH levels \\n[12]. AIs have been shown to profoundly decrease estrogen levels and increase FSH \\nlevels in postmenopausal patients [12]. CT can also cause significant changes in \\novarian function by directly destroying remnant functional follicles or indirectly \\npromoting the loss of functional follicles through induction of ovarian fibrosis. CT \\ncan also lead to amenorrhea by inducing primary or hypergonadotropic \\n hypogonadism [13]. The risk of CT-induced primary ovarian insufficiency (POI) \\nhas been correlated with CT type, higher cumulative CT dose, and older age, with \\nage >40\\xa0years being the strongest predictor of both chemotherapy-induced amenor-\\nrhea (CIA) and chemotherapy-induced menopause (CIM) [14, 15]. Therefore, in \\nthese clinical settings, FSH/E2 levels are not reliable surrogate markers of \\nmenopause.\\nAssessment of ovarian function is important in hormone-sensitive breast cancer \\npatients who are eligible to receive adjuvant ET (Box 17.1). Adjuvant AI treatment \\nadministered upfront or switching to tamoxifen has proved to be superior to tamoxi-\\nfen alone in postmenopausal patients and therefore has become the standard of care \\nin these patients. By contrast, adjuvant treatment with tamoxifen with or without \\novarian suppression is recommended in premenopausal women. Tamoxifen can be \\nsafely given to premenopausal women; however, this is not the case for AIs. AIs \\ninterfere with androgen to estrogen conversion by blocking aromatase, thereby low-\\nering E2 levels in truly postmenopausal women. However, in the presence of func-\\ntional ovaries, low levels of estrogen will enhance pituitary FSH production, thereby \\nindirectly stimulating follicular aromatase production and subsequent E2 produc-\\ntion. Consequently, AI treatment in the absence of an LHRH agonist may be inef-\\nfective in postmenopausal women inaccurately classified as premenopausal. \\nMoreover, in the case of CIA, AIs may promote recovery of ovarian function, lead-\\ning to therapeutic failure and even to unwanted pregnancy.\\n422 I. Yildiz and A. Aydiner\\nEndocrine strategies in premenopausal women include estrogen receptor block-\\nade with tamoxifen, temporary ovarian suppression with LHRH agonists, or perma-\\nnent ovarian suppression with oophorectomy or radiotherapy. Tamoxifen is the \\nmainstay of ET in premenopausal women. In patients receiving both tamoxifen and \\nchemotherapy, chemotherapy should be given first, followed by sequential tamoxi-\\nfen. Prospective randomized trials have demonstrated that 5\\xa0years of tamoxifen is \\nmore effective than 1–2\\xa0years of tamoxifen.\\nThe 2011 EBCTCG meta-analysis, which compared 5\\xa0years of tamoxifen treat-\\nment to no ET in premenopausal and postmenopausal women, was instrumental in \\nestablishing the efficacy of adjuvant tamoxifen [16]. Tamoxifen treatment resulted in \\na 39% reduction in breast cancer recurrence compared with placebo (relative risk \\n[RR] 0.61, 95% CI 0.57–0.65), which translated to a 15-year absolute reduction of \\n13% (33% vs. 46%). This outcome was observed in both node-negative and node- \\npositive patients. Tamoxifen treatment also resulted in a 30% reduction in breast can-\\ncer mortality risk (RR 0.70, 95% CI 0.64–0.75), which translated to a 15-year absolute \\nreduction of 9% (24% vs. 33%). The magnitude of benefit was similar between \\nwomen <45 and 55–69\\xa0years of age. Tamoxifen also reduced the risk of local recur-\\nrence (RR 0.54; P\\xa0<\\xa00.000001) and contralateral breast cancer (RR 0.62; P\\xa0<\\xa00.00001).\\n Duration of\\xa0Tamoxifen\\nFor decades, tamoxifen for 5\\xa0years has been the standard ET for premenopausal \\nwomen [17]. Tamoxifen for more than 5\\xa0years has not been shown to be more ben-\\neficial than tamoxifen for 5\\xa0years in two North American and Scottish trials [18, 19]. \\nHowever, the results of the ATLAS (Adjuvant Tamoxifen-Longer Against Shorter) \\nand Adjuvant Tamoxifen-To Offer More (aTTom) trials have recently changed this \\nparadigm [20]. The ATLAS study, which randomized nearly 7000 ER-positive \\npatients between 5 and 10\\xa0years tamoxifen, showed a benefit for continuing tamoxi-\\nfen with an absolute benefit of 3.7% (21.4% vs 25.1%) for recurrence risk and an \\nabsolute mortality reduction of 2.8% (12.2% vs 15%). Remarkably, these benefits \\nwere mainly observed in the 10\\xa0years after treatment was ceased. This was attrib-\\nuted to a carryover effect, which is well known for tamoxifen. However, fewer than \\n20% of patients enrolled in ATLAS had low risk (i.e., node negative or tumor size \\n<2\\xa0cm); therefore, it is difficult to determine the true benefit of extending tamoxifen \\ntherapy for these patients. Similar results were observed in the ATTOM trial [21]. \\nCombining the results of the ATTOM and ATLAS trials enhanced the statistical \\nsignificance of the benefits for recurrence (P\\xa0 <\\xa0 0.0001), breast cancer mortality \\n(P\\xa0=\\xa00.002), and OS (P\\xa0=\\xa00.005). Tamoxifen is associated with an increased risk of \\nthromboembolic events (1–2% increased risk of deep venous thrombosis and three-\\nfold increased risk of pulmonary embolism), increased vaginal bleeding, and a \\nthreefold increased risk of endometrial cancer. However, the absolute increase in \\nendometrial cancer is <1%, and almost all cancers that develop are stage I \\nadenocarcinomas.\\n17 Adjuvant Endocrine Therapy for\\xa0Breast Cancer 423\\nThe expression of growth factor receptors, such as HER2, is associated with the \\ndevelopment of tamoxifen resistance in breast cancer [22]. Studies suggest that PgR \\nnegativity in ER-positive tumors may be associated with increased growth factor \\nexpression, a more aggressive tumor phenotype, and tamoxifen resistance. By con-\\ntrast, higher quantitative ER levels have been shown to predict greater tamoxifen \\nbenefits. Other factors that may contribute to tamoxifen resistance include variable \\nexpression of ERα and ERβ isoforms, interference with coactivator and corepressor \\nbinding, alternative splicing of ER mRNA variants, modulators of ER expression \\n(e.g., epidermal growth factor and its receptors such as epidermal growth factor \\nreceptor-1 and HER2), and inherited drug-metabolizing CYP2D6 genotypes [23, \\n24]. Given the limited and conflicting evidence at this time, the NCCN Breast \\nCancer guideline does not recommend CYP2D6 testing as a tool to determine the \\noptimal adjuvant endocrine strategy.\\n Ovarian Suppression\\nOvarian ablation therapy is the oldest type of breast cancer therapy. The ovaries are \\nthe main site of estrogen production in premenopausal women. Therefore, ovarian \\nablation/suppression is an endocrine therapeutic option to consider in young women \\nwith ER-positive disease. In premenopausal women, cessation of ovarian function \\ncan be achieved on a temporary basis by pharmacological interventions that inhibit \\novarian production of estrogen, such as gonadotropin-releasing hormone (LHRH) \\nagonists, or permanently by surgery (oophorectomy) or pelvic radiation (ovarian \\nablation). Goserelin, leuprolide, and triptorelin are also used for chemical ovarian \\nsuppression; however, only goserelin has been approved by the FDA.\\nFor premenopausal patients, monotherapy with tamoxifen was the standard \\ntherapy for a long time, with a possible benefit from ovarian suppression for \\npatients 40\\xa0 years of age and younger [25]. Recently, the results of the TEXT \\n(Tamoxifen and Exemestane Trial) and SOFT (The Suppression of Ovarian \\nFunction Trial) trials revealed that for premenopausal patients, addition of ovarian \\nfunction suppression should be considered for patients younger than 35\\xa0 years \\n(5-year breast cancer-free interval of 67.7% for tamoxifen vs 78.9% for tamoxifen \\nplus OFS and 83.4% for exemestane plus OFS) or who received chemotherapy \\n(5-year breast cancer-free interval 78% for tamoxifen vs 82.5% for tamoxifen plus \\nOFS vs 85.7% for exemestane plus OFS) [26]. The OS data from these trials are \\nstill pending because overall follow-up is relatively short in the context of endo-\\ncrine-sensitive disease.\\nIn addition, randomized trials have shown that ovarian suppression with GnRH \\nagonist therapy administered during adjuvant chemotherapy in premenopausal \\nwomen with ER-negative tumors may preserve ovarian function and diminish the \\nlikelihood of chemotherapy-induced amenorrhea.\\nThe abrupt interruption of ovarian function is a significant problem in young \\npremenopausal patients. Adverse events may include severe menopause-related \\n424 I. Yildiz and A. Aydiner\\nsigns and symptoms, psychological distress, impaired quality of life, sexual dys-\\nfunction, changes in personal and family relationships, and bone loss.\\nThe St Gallen International Breast Cancer Conference (2017) reviewed substan-\\ntial new evidence on systemic therapies for early breast cancer. For premenopausal \\npatients with endocrine responsive, the Panel endorsed the role of ovarian function \\nsuppression with either tamoxifen or exemestane for patients at higher risk. More \\ngenerally, the Panel considered that the factors arguing for the inclusion of OFS \\nwere age 35 or less, persisting premenopausal estrogen levels after adjuvant chemo-\\ntherapy; or the involvement of four or more axillary nodes. A lesser majority would \\nadd grade 3 disease or an adverse result from a multiparameter molecular marker \\ntest as indications for OFS.\\xa0The panel noted the value an LHRH agonist given dur-\\ning chemotherapy for premenopausal women with ER-negative disease in protect-\\ning against premature ovarian failure and preserving fertility.\\nFor premenopausal women, the evidence-based choices are tamoxifen for \\n5–10\\xa0years; tamoxifen for 5\\xa0years followed by AI for 5\\xa0years; and ovarian suppres-\\nsion with tamoxifen or AI, which should be considered for higher-risk patients \\n(<35\\xa0 years, premenopausal after chemotherapy and multiple positive axillary \\nnodes). In low-risk hormone receptor-positive premenopausal breast cancer, OA is \\nnot beneficial, and tamoxifen remains the anti-hormone treatment of choice.\\n Adjuvant Endocrine Therapy for\\xa0Postmenopausal Women\\nApproximately 75% of breast cancers are diagnosed in postmenopausal women, \\n80% of which are HR-positive [27]. Third-generation AIs, including anastrozole, \\nletrozole, and exemestane, block estrogen synthesis by inhibiting aromatase. \\nBecause these AIs do not block ovarian estrogen production, their use is limited to \\npostmenopausal women (Box 17.1) (Fig.\\xa017.5).\\nA number of studies have compared AIs with tamoxifen in the adjuvant setting \\nusing either a head-to-head (i.e., randomly assigning patients to 5\\xa0years of either \\ndrug) or switch schedule approach (i.e., initial tamoxifen for 2–3\\xa0years followed by \\neither an AI for 2–3\\xa0years or continued tamoxifen for a total of 5\\xa0years). The results \\nof the ATAC, BIG 1-98 and TEAM trials clearly show that AI-containing adjuvant \\nregimes, either as a monotherapy or as a switch scheme, are preferred over tamoxi-\\nfen monotherapy. The use of AIs in either approach reduces breast cancer recur-\\nrence rates compared with tamoxifen alone; however, their effect on survival is less \\nclear [28]. Randomized studies showed no significant difference in recurrence or \\nsurvival between upfront and switching AI therapy [29–31]. The Early Breast \\nCancer Trialist’s Cooperative Group (EBCTCG) meta-analysis also showed that \\n5-year adjuvant endocrine treatment including AIs was more effective than tamoxi-\\nfen monotherapy in preventing recurrence and breast cancer death in either continu-\\nous or sequential regimens [32].\\nHormone receptor-positive breast cancer is characterized by a very long natural \\nhistory. As a consequence, some women remain at risk of late recurrence for years, \\n17 Adjuvant Endocrine Therapy for\\xa0Breast Cancer 425\\nfueling the discussion to prolong endocrine therapy beyond 5\\xa0years. The risk of \\nbreast cancer recurrence after 5\\xa0years of endocrine therapy was evaluated in a meta- \\nanalysis by the EBCTCG.\\xa0In that meta-analysis, breast cancer recurrences occurred \\nat a steady rate throughout the study period from 5 to 20\\xa0years, strongly correlated \\nwith the original tumor- and nodal status and tumor grade [33]. Several trials, \\nincluding the large MA.17 trial and the smaller ABCSG 6 and NSABP B-33 trials, \\nhave also demonstrated that extended ET with 3–5\\xa0years of an AI following 5\\xa0years \\nof tamoxifen decreases relapse rates and may affect survival, especially in women \\nwith nodal involvement [34–37] (Table\\xa017.1). The MA.17 trial demonstrated that \\ncompared with placebo, extended letrozole therapy provided a survival advantage in \\nwomen with axillary lymph node-positive but not in those with lymph node-n egative \\nER-positive breast cancer [34]. The recently reported MA.17R trial randomized \\nwomen who had already completed 5\\xa0years of aromatase inhibitor therapy with or \\nwithout previous tamoxifen to a further 5\\xa0years of letrozole or placebo. DFS was \\nsignificantly improved in the extended letrozole group, quality of life was similar, \\nbut bone fracture rates were higher. The 5-year DFS rate was 95% for the letrozole \\narm compared with 91% for the placebo arm [hazard ratio 0.66, 95% CI (0.48–\\n0.91); P\\xa0<\\xa00.01] [35].\\nSeveral studies investigated the efficacy and safety of additional treatment with \\nAIs after a sequential regimen of tamoxifen and an AI for 5\\xa0years [38–40]. However, \\nresults from NSABP-B42, the DATA trial, and the IDEAL trial have not confirmed \\nthe benefit on recurrence-free survival seen in MA17R.\\xa0 The NSABP B42 study \\ninvestigated the efficacy of 5\\xa0years of letrozole after an initial 5-year of endocrine \\ntherapy including an AI.\\xa0This could be either AI monotherapy, or sequenced with \\ntamoxifen. In contrast to the findings of the MA.17R trial, the difference in DFS \\nbetween the control and placebo groups did not reach statistical significance [7-year \\nDFS 84.7 vs 81.3%, HR 0.85, P\\xa0=\\xa00.048, statistical significance level 0.0418]. For \\nOS, a significant difference between the control and placebo groups was also not \\nfound [91.8 vs 92.3%, HR 1.15, P\\xa0=\\xa00.22]. However, patients under extended endo-\\ncrine therapy were significantly less frequently affected by distant recurrence [HR \\n0.72, P\\xa0=\\xa00.03]; a risk reduction of 28% was observed. Furthermore, a significantly \\nlonger BC-free interval (BCFI), defined as time to recurrence or contralateral BC as \\nthe first event, could be observed in the letrozole group [incidence of BCFI events \\n6.7 vs 10.0%, HR 0.71, P\\xa0=\\xa00.003] [38].\\nThe DATA trial presented at the San Antonio Breast Cancer Symposium in 2016 \\nwas designed to investigate the effect of extended AI therapy after TAM.\\xa0 In this \\nmulticenter phase III trial, 1660 postmenopausal women with HR-positive early \\nbreast cancer who underwent 2–3\\xa0years of TAM therapy, were randomized to 6 or \\n3\\xa0years of anastrozole daily.

For exam-\\nple, The SOLE phase III trial included 4884 postmenopausal women with HR+, N+ \\nearly-stage BC with the purpose of investigating the effect of a new therapeutic con-\\ncept of letrozole [42]. The trial was designed to assess the role of continuous versus \\nintermittent letrozole intake.

After \\n60\\xa0months of follow-up, similar 5-year DFS rates were observed in patients with inter-\\nmittent and continuous letrozole administration [85.8 vs 87.5%, HR 1.08, P\\xa0=\\xa00.31].\\nSequential rather than concurrent administration of cytotoxic and endocrine ther-\\napies should be used. The concurrent use of tamoxifen and anthracyclines has been \\nshown to have detrimental effects, whereas the concurrent use of AIs and CT has not \\nbeen investigated [7].\\nThe prognostic significance of ER and PR levels, PR negativity, HER2 overex-\\npression, Ki67 levels, and 21-gene RS has been examined. In the initial exploratory \\nanalysis of the ATAC trial, a greater benefit of anastrozole compared with tamoxifen \\nin the PR-negative subgroup was suggested. The TEAM trial showed that, in patients \\nreceiving exemestane, the ER and PR expression levels predicted DFS.\\xa0The relative \\nrisk of relapse increased with decreased ER and PR expression, and PR status did \\nnot predict treatment response. In the BIG 1-98 trial, more relapses occurred in the \\nfirst 2\\xa0years in women who received tamoxifen followed by letrozole than in those \\nwho received letrozole alone (4.4% vs. 3.1%). This increased risk of relapse was \\nparticularly evident in women with >3 involved nodes (P\\xa0<\\xa00.001), tumors 2\\xa0cm in \\nsize (P\\xa0=\\xa00.001), or vascular invasion (P\\xa0=\\xa00.02). A retrospective analysis demon-\\nstrated that these factors in conjunction with ER and PR levels, Ki67 labeling index, \\nand HER2 status may be useful in guiding the selection of letrozole or tamoxifen \\n[43]. IHC analysis of the nuclear antigen Ki67 is used to estimate the proliferative \\nactivity of tumor cells. Studies have demonstrated the prognostic value of Ki67\\xa0in \\npredicting response and clinical outcomes [44]. One small study suggested that \\nanalysis of Ki67 after short-term ET may be useful in selecting patients who are \\nresistant to ET and may benefit from additional interventions [45]. However, these \\ndata require greater analytical and clinical validation.\\nStudies have consistently demonstrated that the use of third-generation AIs as \\ninitial adjuvant therapy, sequential therapy, or extended therapy lowers recurrence \\nrisk, including ipsilateral breast tumor recurrence, contralateral breast cancer, and \\ndistant metastatic disease, in postmenopausal women with HR-positive breast can-\\ncer. However, a direct comparison of these strategies is not possible given the differ-\\nences in design and patient populations among studies. All three adjuvant strategies \\nhave shown similar antitumor efficacy and toxicity profiles in randomized studies. \\nAlthough it has been shown that letrozole leads to more complete aromatase inhibi-\\ntion [46] and lower serum estrogen levels [47] compared to anastrozole, the clinical \\nimportance of these findings is unclear. To date, indirect comparisons between adju-\\nvant trials suggest that letrozole, anastrozole, and exemestane have similar benefits \\nwhen compared with tamoxifen. In addition, a neoadjuvant study showed that \\n428 I. Yildiz and A. Aydiner\\n letrozole, anastrozole, and exemestane similarly suppress the proliferation marker \\nKi67 and preoperative endocrine prognostic index scores [48].\\nThe St. Gallen Consensus Conference 2017 panel was almost unanimous that \\nsome postmenopausal patients can be treated with tamoxifen alone. Slightly more \\nthan half of the panelists believed that an aromatase inhibitor should be used at \\nsome point during the course of adjuvant therapy. Factors that favored the use of an \\naromatase inhibitor include node positivity, high Ki67, high grade, lobular histol-\\nogy, and HER2 positivity. The Panel recommended longer durations of therapy in \\nwomen with moderate to high risk of recurrence, typically defined as stage II or III \\nbreast cancers [49].\\nTamoxifen and AIs have different side effect profiles, although both can cause hot \\nflashes, night sweats, and vaginal dryness. AIs are more commonly associated with \\nmusculoskeletal symptoms, osteoporosis, and increased rates of bone fracture, whereas \\ntamoxifen is associated with an increased risk of uterine cancer and deep venous \\nthrombosis. Osteoporosis/osteopenia, hypertriglyceridemia, vaginal bleeding, and \\nhypercholesterolemia were less frequent on exemestane, whereas mild liver function \\nabnormalities and rare episodes of atrial fibrillation were less frequent on anastrozole. \\nVasomotor and musculoskeletal symptoms were similar between arms. Compliance is \\na major issue for the use of all chronic medications, including adjuvant ET.\\nThe current version (Version 1.2018) of the NCCN Guideline recommends the \\nfollowing adjuvant ET options for postmenopausal women with early breast cancer: \\n5\\xa0years of AI as initial adjuvant therapy (category 1); 2–3\\xa0years of AI followed by \\ntamoxifen to complete 5\\xa0years of adjuvant ET (category 1); 2–3\\xa0years of tamoxifen \\nfollowed by an AI to complete 5\\xa0years (category 1) or 5\\xa0years of AI alone (category \\n2B); or 5\\xa0years of tamoxifen followed by 5\\xa0years of AI (category 1) (https://www.\\nnccn.org/professionals/physician_gls/pdf/breast.pdf. Breast Cancer, version \\n1.2018). Five years or longer use of tamoxifen alone is limited to postmenopausal \\nwomen who decline AI treatment or have a contraindication to AIs. It is relevant that \\npatients who experience intolerable adverse effects on initial adjuvant AI therapy \\nand switch to tamoxifen after 2\\xa0years have similar outcomes to those who complete \\n5\\xa0years of AI therapy [30]. Switching to a different AI is reasonable because 39% of \\npatients are able to tolerate an alternative AI [50]. In conclusion, AI use, either \\nupfront or after 2–3\\xa0years of tamoxifen, should be recommended for the majority of \\nbreast cancer patients. When choosing between upfront and switch strategies, it is \\nreasonable to weigh the potential added benefit of AIs in reducing early relapse in \\npatients most likely to suffer tamoxifen and AI toxicities [51]. Support from pro-\\nspective studies for the preferential use of upfront AI in patients with greater tumor \\nburdens or more aggressive tumor biology would be extremely useful [43].\\n Conclusion\\nAdjuvant endocrine therapy should be administered to patients with ER-positive \\nand/or PR-positive invasive breast cancer, regardless of HER2 status, patient age, \\nor cytotoxic therapy provided. Endocrine therapy can be initiated either with or \\n17 Adjuvant Endocrine Therapy for\\xa0Breast Cancer 429\\nafter radiotherapy. In high-risk patients with multiple poor prognostic factors, an \\naromatase inhibitor (AI) (plus OFS in premenopausal patients) may be the best \\ntreatment option.\\nBox 17.1\\nThe definition of menopause.

The estimated five-year overall \\nsurvival rates exceed 89% following the initial diagnosis of early-stage breast can-\\ncer [1, 2]. Hence, the long-term toxicities of chemotherapeutics and other adjuvant \\ntherapies should be considered for breast cancer survivors.\\nSystemic therapies for treating early breast cancer can be associated with accel-\\nerated bone loss and an increased risk of osteoporotic fractures. Bone mineral den-\\nsity (BMD) can decrease as a result of a temporary or permanent suppression of \\novarian function due to chemotherapy and/or the end organ effect of gonadotropin- \\nreleasing hormone (GnRH) agonists, aromatase inhibitors and tamoxifen.\\nThis chapter focuses on the use of bone-targeted drugs for the preservation of \\nBMD in adjuvant treatment, the long-term follow-up setting of early breast cancer, \\nand the use of bone-targeted agents to aid adjuvant therapy to impact breast cancer \\noutcomes.\\nE.

Cicin\\n Breast Cancer-Associated Bone Loss\\n Epidemiology of\\xa0Breast Cancer Treatment-Associated Bone \\nLoss\\n Epidemiology in\\xa0Premenopausal Women\\nUnder normal conditions, estrogen plays a key role in maintaining bone integrity \\nand density to ensure that a premenopausal woman’s bones are healthy and strong. \\nPremenopausal women face osteoporosis secondary to the effects of systemic thera-\\npies [3, 4]. Chemotherapeutics may result in temporary or permanent ovarian fail-\\nure; tamoxifen alone or in conjunction with gonadotropin-releasing hormone \\nantagonists (GnRHa) or supportive medicines such as glucocorticoids lead to a pre-\\nmaturely induced osteoporotic state that puts women with a history of breast cancer \\nat risk of osteoporosis and osteoporotic complications.\\nA woman diagnosed with breast cancer in early life has an anticipated long life \\nexpectancy, which demands necessary measures to screen, diagnose and treat osteo-\\nporosis. Premenopausal women should be reviewed and assessed for the risk of \\nbone loss, and a dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DEXA) scan can be offered. \\nThe risk of bone loss is related to the age of diagnosis, the age of initial treatment \\nand the type of treatment. According to the results of observational studies, bone \\nmineral density (BMD) decreases by 3–8% after 12\\xa0months of chemotherapy in the \\npremenopausal stage [5, 6]. Tamoxifen has been shown to cause bone loss alone \\nboth in the adjuvant setting and with GnRHa [7–10]. The accelerated bone loss of \\nearly artificial menopause versus the delayed, longstanding bone loss that proceeds \\nover years have not been formally compared, and the fracture risk of decreased \\nBMD has not been proven. Finally, it is not yet clear how the DEXA value changes \\nfracture effects.\\n Epidemiology in\\xa0Postmenopausal Women\\nPostmenopausal women have a significantly increased risk of osteoporosis and skel-\\netal events after the diagnosis of cancer. Preliminary studies have shown that post-\\nmenopausal women with breast cancer are at risk of osteoporosis due to \\nchemotherapy [11]. Subgroup analyses of the Women Health Initiative Study \\nrevealed that in both the prospective and observational study groups, women faced \\nincreased BMD loss after the diagnosis of cancer as well as increased risks of falls \\nand fractures [12–14]. Women receiving adjuvant chemotherapy may lose 1–10% \\nof bone mass per year of chemotherapy [11].\\nAdjuvant hormonotherapy has been more thoroughly studied in postmenopausal \\nwomen. It is well known that adjuvant aromatase inhibitors have a class effect of \\naccelerated bone loss and promotion of fractures. By contrast, the end organ effect \\nof tamoxifen as a selective estrogen receptor modulator may induce bone stabiliza-\\ntion [7, 8, 15].\\n18 Bone-Targeted Therapy in\\xa0Early Breast Cancer 435\\n Prevention of\\xa0Breast Cancer Treatment-Associated Bone Loss\\n Prevention in\\xa0Premenopausal Women\\nThe main preventive measures in premenopausal women are to avoid factors that \\nincrease bone loss by eliminating smoking, controlling thyroid hormone functions \\nand optimizing vitamin D and calcium intake. If the osteoporosis risk is estimated \\nto be high, pharmacologic intervention is required.\\nIn premenopausal women, bisphosphonates are proven to preserve the bone \\nreserve when used in patients with early secondary ovarian failure either due to che-\\nmotherapy or GnRHa use. Although BMD is preserved, there are less data on frac-\\nture prevention and the timing of bisphosphonate initiation and risk reduction. In \\npremenopausal women with decreased BMD secondary to all causes, bisphospho-\\nnates could be started after necessary changes and measures are implemented [16].\\nThere are some small-size studies of the use of medications in women with breast \\ncancer. Clodronate, risedronate, pamidronate and zoledronic acid are among the \\nbisphosphonates studied in premenopausal breast cancer patients [7, 9, 18, 19].\\nThe CALGB 70809 (Cancer and Leukemia Group B) Trial 79809 enrolled early \\nbreast cancer patients requiring adjuvant chemotherapy who were at least 40\\xa0years \\nold and investigated the efficacy of zoledronic acid on BMD [20]. Zoledronic acid \\nwas given either as an upfront therapy of 4\\xa0mg every 3\\xa0months for 2\\xa0years or delayed \\nto begin 1\\xa0year after randomization. All participants were advised and self-reported \\nto take daily intake of 400\\xa0IU of vitamin D with 1000\\xa0mg calcium. In 1\\xa0year, 150 of \\n439 women developed chemotherapy-induced secondary ovarian failure. Zoledronic \\nacid was found to be associated with an increase in lumbar spine BMD, and delayed \\nuse was reported as the preferred sequence.\\nResults for zoledronic acid were reported in ABCSG (The Austrian Breast and \\nColorectal Cancer Study Group)-12 trial as a subgroup analysis [7]. This trial was a \\nfour-arm study in which tamoxifen with goserelin and anastrozole with goserelin \\nwere compared either with zoledronic acid or alone. Patients were given zoledronic \\nacid 4\\xa0mg every 6\\xa0months. The results showed that BMD decreased significantly \\nwith endocrine therapy, but the decrease was highest with anastrozole. Zoledronic \\nacid was significantly associated with the stabilization of BMD.\\n Prevention in\\xa0Postmenopausal Women\\nPostmenopausal women are a population at high risk for osteoporosis due to age and \\ngender. Adjuvant endocrine therapy is associated with additional loss of bone mass. \\nMany postmenopausal women who are diagnosed with breast cancer receive che-\\nmotherapy and adjuvant endocrine hormonotherapy, which have been proven to \\ndecrease BMD further. These patients should be screened for vitamin D deficiency; \\nBMD can be evaluated by DEXA, and if a risk of osteoporosis and fracture is found, \\nbisphosphonates may be indicated [11, 12, 14, 21]. Denosumab is a fully humanized \\nmonoclonal antibody to the receptor activator of nuclear factor kappa-B (RANK) \\n436 E. Esin and I. Cicin\\nligand. This ligand is responsible for osteoclastic differentiation; thereby, deno-\\nsumab inhibits osteoclast differentiation and prevents bone loss. In the ABCSG-1 8 \\ntrial, denosumab 60\\xa0mg twice yearly was shown to decrease osteoporotic fractures \\nin postmenopausal women associated with aromatase inhibitor therapy [17].\\n Impact of\\xa0Bone-Targeted Treatment on\\xa0Breast Cancer \\nOutcomes\\n The Role of\\xa0Adjuvant Bisphosphonates\\nAlthough there is a clear role of bisphosphonates in preventing osteoporosis and \\nrelated bone fractures, the data supporting their use as adjuvant treatment in early \\nbreast cancer are continuously evolving.\\nCirculating tumor cells may stay dormant in body and can be attracted years later \\nto surfaces within the bones. Binding of these cells to osteoblastic niches can result \\nin the development of bone metastases [22]. The hypothesis of adjuvant bisphos-\\nphonate treatment developed from the fact that bisphosphonate has a negative effect \\non osteoclasts and affects T-cell function [23, 24]. Consequently, bisphosphonate \\ncan delay or prevent bone recurrences [25]. Thus, in addition to the use of bisphos-\\nphonate for osteoporosis prevention in postmenopausal women, Bisphosphonate \\ncan be added to adjuvant treatment for the prevention of bone recurrences. However, \\nthe data showing that bisphosphonates improve bone metastasis-free survival, \\ndisease-f ree survival and overall survival are controversial.\\nOral clodronate and zoledronic acid were shown to be effective in some adjuvant \\ntrials [26–28]. However, in other trials, no significant benefit or some benefit was \\nachieved only in postmenopausal or ovarian-suppressed [29–31]. In an individual \\ndata meta-analysis by EBCTCG (Early Breast Cancer Trialist’ Collaborative \\nGroup), there was a definitive benefit of bisphosphonate in improving breast cancer- \\nspecific survival rates only in postmenopausal women [32]. The Cochrane analyses \\nclearly determined overall survival and disease-free survival benefits for postmeno-\\npausal women [33]. However, current guidelines are generally in favor of the \\n addition of bisphosphonates to adjuvant treatment: a European Panel consensus rec-\\nommends zoledronic acid 4\\xa0mg iv twice yearly or oral clodronate 1600\\xa0mg daily for \\na period of 3–5\\xa0years, especially in ovarian-suppressed premenopausal women and \\npostmenopausal women at intermediate-high risk [34]. By contrast, ASCO advises \\nconsidering the addition of bisphosphonate when systemic adjuvant therapy is \\nplanned [35]. There are scarce data showing an advantage of one bisphosphonate \\nover another. However, there is insufficient evidence on adjuvant alendronate or \\nrisedronate for improving breast cancer-specific survival rates. In the SWOG \\n(Southwest Oncology Group) S0307 study, oral clodronate, oral ibandronate (50\\xa0mg \\noral daily) and zoledronic acid were compared in the adjuvant setting [36]. The \\nSWOG S0307 results showed that oral therapy was preferred to iv zoledronic acid. \\n18 Bone-Targeted Therapy in\\xa0Early Breast Cancer 437\\nThis study did not have a control arm; hence the data do not support bisphosphonate \\nto improve survival outcomes. There is no clear evidence of the dose or duration of \\nbisphosphonate treatment as adjuvant therapy in early breast cancer; the doses used \\nin osteoporosis treatment (zoledronic acid. 4\\xa0mg twice yearly and oral clodronate \\n1600\\xa0mg per day) for a duration of 3–5\\xa0years are the preferred regimens.\\n The Role of\\xa0Adjuvant Anti-Rank Ligand\\nDenosumab as an osteoclast differentiation inhibitor may have a role in preventing \\nosteoporosis-related fractures and may increase breast cancer-specific survival \\nrates; however, the data are not yet mature. EBCST-18 was a phase III, randomized \\nstudy enrolling postmenopausal hormone receptor-positive breast cancer patients. \\nIn this study, patients were randomized one-to-one to either denosumab 60\\xa0 mg \\ntwice yearly or placebo. The primary endpoint was to show a decrease in fractures, \\nand PFS was a secondary endpoint. Patients who received denosumab experienced \\nless fractures, and DFS was in favor of the denosumab arm in four-year follow-up. \\nFurther final results of denosumab studies are awaited to draw conclusions about its \\nefficacy in the survival rates of early breast cancer (NCT01077154).\\n Toxicity Related to\\xa0Bone-Targeted Therapy\\nDespite the overall beneficial effects of bisphosphonates and denosumab, these \\nagents are not without adverse events and have some common relatively predictable \\ntoxicities. In general, they may result in acute-phase reactions, hypocalcemia, and \\nosteonecrosis of the jaw (ONJ). Oral bisphosphonates may result in some degree of \\ngastrointestinal irritation. Occasionally, subcutaneous local reactions are observed \\nwith denosumab [37, 38]. In randomized studies, both medications resulted in seri-\\nous side effects at the same rates, and treatment discontinuation rates due to adverse \\nevents were similar for both agents [39]. Acute-phase reactions are flu-like symp-\\ntoms, which usually occur within 3\\xa0days and may be observed in 10% of patients \\ntaking bisphosphonates or denosumab [40]. Paracetamol, nonsteroidal anti- \\ninflammatories with caution for the glomerular filtration rate and antipyretics can be \\nused for symptomatic treatment [41].\\nBisphosphonates are excreted from the kidneys, and their metabolism is highly \\ndependent on the glomerular filtration rate (GFR) and the applied dose. Among \\nbisphosphonates, zoledronic acid is the most frequently reported cause of renal fail-\\nure [42, 43]. The renal toxicity of zoledronic acid may be reversible, but pamidro-\\nnate is associated with nephrotic syndrome, which may not be reversible [44, 45]. \\nBy contrast, denosumab is relatively safe in renal aspects compared to bisphospho-\\nnates. In patients with normal function as well as patients with a decreased GFR, \\ndenosumab can be safely administered without any dose change [35, 37, 38, 46]. To \\n438 E. Esin and I. Cicin\\navoid bisphosphonate-induced nephrotoxicity, patients should be screened for GFR \\nbefore each bisphosphonate application, and bisphosphonates should not be given \\nif the GFR is below 30\\xa0ml/min.\\nHypocalcemia is a shared toxicity of bisphosphonates and denosumab and is \\nrelated to antiresorptive activities. The risk of hypocalcemia is higher if there is a \\npre-existing vitamin D deficiency, hypothyroidism or hypoparathyroidism. \\nBisphosphonates have a relatively lower risk of hypocalcemia development com-\\npared to denosumab [39]. The risk of denosumab-associated hypocalcemia is espe-\\ncially high if the GFR is below 30\\xa0ml/min; therefore, precautions should be taken, \\nsuch as proper administration of supplemental calcium and vitamin D.\\nOsteonecrosis of the jaw is one of the most debilitating complications of bone \\ntargeting in malignancies and is well recognized. It is related to osteonecrosis of the \\nmandible and/or maxilla. Apart from the use of bisphosphonates or denosumab, \\npoor oral hygiene and preceding oral interventions such as tooth extraction has been \\ndefined as risk factors. The risk of ONJ increases continuously with repeated doses \\nand lower intervals of bone-targeted agent use [47]. No statistically significant dif-\\nference was observed in the ONJ rates between denosumab and bisphosphonates \\n[47, 48]. Although there is a class-generated toxicity of ONJ in bisphosphonates, \\nnitrogen-containing zoledronic acid is more responsible for ONJ than are pamidro-\\nnate and ibandronate [49]. To avoid ONJ, preventive measures such as oral hygiene, \\nregular dental care and avoiding dental procedures should be taken.\\n Conclusion\\nSystemic adjuvant chemotherapy and hormonotherapy may result in osteoporosis in \\nboth premenopausal and postmenopausal women diagnosed with early breast can-\\ncer. Bisphosphonates and denosumab have proven efficacy in the prevention and \\ntreatment of secondary osteoporosis associated with treatment modalities. Evidence \\nsupporting a survival benefit of bone-targeted agents is evolving but mainly involves \\npostmenopausal patients. The toxicity of bone–targeted agents should be kept in \\nmind, and the necessary precautions should be taken.\\nReferences\\n 1.

In this chapter, RT\\xa0for\\xa0in situ disease and inva-\\nsive disease, boost RT, accelerated partial-breast irradiation, hypofractionation, and \\nregional lymphatic irradiation are discussed.\\n Radiotherapy in\\xa0Ductal Carcinoma In\\xa0Situ Disease\\nIn ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS), breast RT following surgery with clear margins \\nhas been shown to decrease in-breast relapse rates by approximately one half without \\na survival benefit\\xa0or distant metastasis-free survival benefit in prospective randomized \\ntrials [1]. In a\\xa0recently published systematic review and meta-analysis of 5 prospective \\nand 21 retrospective studies including 9391 DCIS patients with ≥10\\xa0years follow- up, \\nlocal recurrence was found\\xa02.6%, 13.6%, 25.5%, and 27.8% for mastectomy, breast-\\nconserving surgery (BCS) with RT, BCS without RT and biopsy only, respectively. In \\naddition, the local recurrence rates were reduced with the addition of RT\\xa0+\\xa0tamoxifen \\n(TAM) to BCS, with local recurrence rates of 9.7% for BCS\\xa0+\\xa0RT\\xa0+\\xa0TAM; 14.1% for \\nBCS\\xa0+\\xa0RT; 24.7% for BCS\\xa0+\\xa0TAM; and 25.1% for BCS (p\\xa0<\\xa00.0001). Furthermore, \\ntriple treatment modalities including BCS, RT and TAM led to lower rates of local \\ninvasive relapse compared with BCS alone (odds ratio (OR): 2.61, p\\xa0 <\\xa0 0.0001), \\nK.

By contrast, \\nbreast cancer-related death rates were similar among the mastectomy, BCS\\xa0±\\xa0RT (1.3–\\n2%) and biopsy-only groups (2.7%) [2].\\nIf total mastectomy is performed with negative margins, there is no need for \\nadjuvant irradiation rates since total mastectomy provides local control rates equiv-\\nalent to those of excision and breast RT [3–5]. In cases operated with nipple-sparing \\nmastectomy and reconstruction, irradiation of the nipple-areola complex is not stan-\\ndard. Breast tissue that is inadvertently left under the skin flaps should not be an \\nindication for postoperative RT.\\nIn cases treated with lumpectomy, adjuvant RT using partial-breast irradiation \\n(PBI) techniques is under investigation in randomized trials, and this approach is con-\\nsidered “suitable” for DCIS that meets all criteria (detected by screening, low to inter-\\nmediate nuclear grade, size ≥2.5\\xa0cm, and negative margins at ≥3\\xa0mm) and\\xa0“unsuitable” \\nfor DCIS with size >3\\xa0cm by the American Society for Radiation Oncology (ASTRO) \\nand other groups [6–9]. Lumpectomy without RT has been investigated in prospective \\nand randomized trials in patients who are considered to be at low risk of local recur-\\nrence [10, 11]. Common sense in such low-risk DCIS patients is to consider whole-\\nbreast RT by decision making with the patient while taking age, comorbidity, radiation \\nrisks, patient preference, and salvage options into account. To consider a patient\\xa0as a \\nlow-risk DCIS case, the following criteria must be present: mammographic detection, \\nno palpable mass, lesion size smaller than 2.5\\xa0cm, nuclear grade I or II, and clear \\nsurgical margins of at least 3\\xa0mm [12]. All other cases of DCIS treated with lumpec-\\ntomy are candidates for whole-breast irradiation [4, 13–15].\\nThe recently defined adequate surgical margin for DCIS is 2\\xa0mm for patients\\xa0treated \\nwith BCS and whole-breast RT in the consensus guidelines of Society of Surgical \\nOncology (SSO), American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO), and ASTRO [16]. \\nHowever, close margins at the chest wall or skin do\\xa0not  warrant re- excision for DCIS, \\nbut a higher boost dose can be given to the involved lumpectomy site. Boost to the \\ntumor bed may be an indication particularly for patients ≤50\\xa0years of age with nega-\\ntive margins to minimize local recurrence [17].\\nThe safety and efficacy of hypofractionation (40–42\\xa0Gy/15–16 fraction) and boost \\nfor DCIS compared with conventional fractionation were shown in a meta-a nalysis by \\nNelson et\\xa0al. Patients with positive margins benefited\\xa0from boost to the tumor bed in \\nthis analysis [18]. In addition, an increase in the 15-year local control rate was reported \\nfor DCIS patients who received boost treatment in a multicenter retrospective study \\npresented during the ASCO annual meeting in 2016 (91.6% vs. 88.0%, p\\xa0=\\xa00.013) \\n[19]. The results of ongoing randomized trials are pending to clarify the roles of hypo-\\nfractionation (the TROG 07.01 trial) and boost RT (the TROG 07.01 trial \\n(NCT00470236) and the Bonbis trial (NCT00907868)) in patients with DCIS.\\n Radiotherapy in\\xa0Invasive Disease\\nPostmastectomy radiotherapy (PMRT) in patients with 4 or more LNs with meta-\\nstatic involvement is the standard of care [20] (Figs.\\xa019.1 and 19.2). However, the \\nbenefit of PMRT in patients with 1–3 involved nodes was more controversial until \\n19 Early-Stage Breast Cancer Radiotherapy 447\\nrecently. Although some trials from the 1990s showed a benefit for PMRT in patients \\nwith involvement of 1–3 nodes, these trials were criticized for using substandard \\nchemotherapy and having unusually high locoregional recurrence rates without \\nPMRT compared to other studies [21–23]. A recent meta-analysis showed more \\nevidence\\xa0of\\xa0a\\xa0benefit of PMRT in 1–3 nodes involved patients [24]. In addition, \\nindirect evidence from a Canadian randomized trial showed benefit (in terms of \\nlocoregional control and disease-free survival but not overall survival) for regional \\nnodal and breast/chest wall irradiation in patients with less than 3 involved nodes \\n[25]. PMRT has been shown to provide no benefit in pathologically node-negative \\npatients with at least 1-mm negative surgical margins [24–26]. NSABP trials ana-\\nlyzed collectively showed no benefit of PMRT in T3N0MX patients [27].\\nRecently, ASCO, ASTRO and SSO updated the guidelines on PMRT.\\xa0The panel \\nrecommended PMRT for patients with T1–2 breast cancer with 1–3 positive LNs, \\nalthough it was stated that the benefit and potential toxicities should be discussed \\nwith low-risk older patients with a limited life expectancy. In addition, PMRT is \\nrecommended in patients with T1–2 tumors and positive SLNB who have not under-\\ngone completion ALND and in clinical stage I or II cancer patients with positive \\naxillary LNs after neoadjuvant chemotherapy. Moreover, the inclusion of both the \\nmammaria interna and supraclavicular-axillary apical nodes in the PMRT field is \\nrecommended in patients with T1–2 tumors with 1–3 positive axillary nodes [28].\\nAfter lumpectomy, whole-breast RT is still considered the standard of care [29–\\n32] (Fig.\\xa019.3). A meta-analysis showed a statistically significant increase in in- \\nbreast control and a decrease in breast cancer-specific deaths [33]. However, \\ncontroversial results have been reported for accelerated partial-breast irradiation \\n(APBI) in patients with a low risk of local recurrence. Two large randomized APBI \\ntrials showed higher in-breast recurrences in patients treated with APBI compared \\nto treatment with whole-breast RT [34, 35]. By contrast, a recently published ran-\\ndomized, phase 3, non-inferiority trial found that 5-year local control and side \\neffects were similar between APBI using sole interstitial multi catheter brachyther-\\nSTAGE I, II, III\\nLumpectomy + axillary staging Mastectomy + axillary staging (proposal 1)\\n(proposal 1) ± reconstruction\\nAdjuvant radiation treatment following Adjuvant radiation treatment following\\nBCS mastectomy\\n≥ 4 positive axillary ≥ 4 positive axillary\\nnodes nodes\\n1-3 positive axillary 1-3 positive axillary\\nnodes nodes\\nNegative axillary Negative axillary\\nnodes nodes\\nFig. 19.1 Evaluation for adjuvant radiotherapy after breast-conserving surgery or mastectomy\\n448 K.

The tumor biology should be considered together with tumor \\nsize and stage in the decision for RT\\xa0after mastectomy. For pN1 low-risk findings, RT should be \\nperformed after having considered the toxicity risks after mastectomy, and doing so is more impor-\\ntant if the patient is to undergo breast reconstruction. Patients with pT1–pT2, pN1 (1–3) and favor-\\nable biological features should be evaluated for omitting RT\\xa0after mastectomy\\napy and whole-breast irradiation with boost after breast-conserving surgery for low- \\nrisk invasive and in situ carcinoma of the female breast [36]. CT-based treatment \\nplanning should be used for target delineation. The most popular technique is tan-\\ngential fields using forward planning (field-in-field) intensity-modulated radiation \\ntherapy (IMRT). The preferred dose homogeneity is ±7%. For left-sided cases, \\nbreath-holding techniques are recommended. The classical dose provided to the \\nwhole breast is 45-50.4 Gy in 25–28 fractions, with an additional boost dose of \\n10–16 Gy in 2 Gy fractions to the tumor bed. In patients older than 50 years with \\nT1/T2N0 disease and clear surgical margins, hypofractionated whole-breast irradia-\\ntion at 42.5 Gy/16 fractions should be considered for both convenience and effec-\\ntiveness. Revised ASTRO guideline in 2018, doesn’t take into account the age and \\nprevious adjuvant chemotherapy administration when considering hypofraction-\\nation for whole breast; recommended doses/fractions are 40Gy/15 or 42.5/16.\\n19 Early-Stage Breast Cancer Radiotherapy 449\\nSTAGE I, IIA, IIB, IIIA, IIIB, IIIC\\nLumpectomy + surgical axillary staging (proposal 1)\\nAdjuvant radiation treatment following BCS(a,-c) (proposal 1) \\n ≥ 4 positive axillary LNs Negative axillary LNs \\n1-3 positive axillary LNs\\nWhole-breast RT ± boost to\\ntumor bed (photon, Whole-breast RT ± boost to tumor bed\\nbrachytherapy or electron rays) Whole-breast RT ± boost to (photon, brachytherapy or electron rays)\\n(proposal 1), RT to infraclavicular tumor bed (photon,\\nand supraclavicular regions brachytherapy or electron rays)\\n(proposal 1)   \\nDefinitively evaluate Evaluate for partial-breast irradiation in\\ninternal mammary selected patients \\nnodes Definitively evaluate for RT to\\ninfraclavicular and supraclavicular\\nregions in selected patients  \\nDefinitively evaluate internal\\nmammary nodes  \\nFig. 19.3 Adjuvant radiotherapy\\xa0(RT) after breast-conserving surgery\\xa0(BCS). aRT following che-\\nmotherapy if chemotherapy is indicated. bFollowing BCS, hypofractionated whole-breast irradia-\\ntion may be used in patients without prior chemotherapy or axillary lymph node involvement, in \\npatients 50\\xa0years of age or older and in patients <50\\xa0years of age. According to the results of a clini-\\ncal trial that randomized low-risk early-stage breast cancer patients, accelerated partial-breast RT \\nwas not inferior to standard whole-breast RT.\\xa0 Partial-breast RT can be performed in ASTRO/\\nESTRO “eligible” low-risk patients, although there are insufficient data in the literature (at St \\nGallen 2017: 67% yes, 24% no). Whole-breast RT should be performed in other patients. Boost \\ntherapy may not be performed in patients aged 60\\xa0years or older, patients with low-grade tumors \\nhaving favorable tumor biology and/or patients who will receive adjuvant endocrine therapy. \\nRegional node irradiation (RNI) prolongs disease-free survival in high-risk patients, but the risk of \\ntoxicity increases and may lead to complications during reconstruction surgery. At St. Gallen 2017, \\nRNI was recommended in pN1 (1–3 positive lymph nodes) in the presence of unfavorable clinical \\nfeatures (40\\xa0years and younger, unfavorable tumor biology, low or negative estrogen-receptor sta-\\ntus, high grade [grade 3], diffuse lymphovascular invasion, and positivity of more than 3 lymph \\nnodes). According to the NCCN guidelines, axilla-negative patients should be evaluated for RNI \\nfor central/medial tumors or >2\\xa0cm tumors and the presence of other risk factors (young age or \\nextensive lymphovascular invasion). cStudies are underway to evaluate the RT\\xa0decision in patients \\nwith complete response after neoadjuvant chemotherapy. Patients must be evaluated individually. \\nThe decision for RT\\xa0is determined according to the disease stage before neoadjuvant chemother-\\napy, but the disease stage may also be important for management after treatment. When the NSABP \\nB-51 and Alliance A11202 studies are completed, they will provide information about the suffi-\\nciency of axillary staging and RT application\\nThere are several different techniques for delivering APBI (such as external \\nbeam, intra-cavitary brachytherapy, interstitial brachytherapy, and intra-operative \\nirradiation). It is suspected that not all of these techniques are capable of achieving \\nadequate local control with low rates of side effects [37, 38]. The results of large \\nrandomized trials must be reported before APBI can be considered standard in some \\npatients [7, 39]. Data are accumulating to consider some elderly (above the age of \\n450 K. Arslan\\xa0Ibis et al.\\n65–70) patients with low-risk disease (T1/T2N0M0), negative margins, and hor-\\nmone receptor-positive tumors without subsequent post lumpectomy RT [40, 41].\\n Boost Radiotherapy\\nSince the site in 65–80% of in-breast recurrence is the first tumor location or its \\nimmediate surroundings, two large randomized trials investigated whether boost \\ncan provide a local control benefit [42, 43]. The Lyon Boost Trial included 1024 \\npatients with stage I–II (<3\\xa0cm tumor) breast cancer. After lumpectomy with nega-\\ntive margins\\xa0+\\xa0axillary LN dissection (ALND) and 50\\xa0Gy RT, patients were random-\\nized to receive 10\\xa0Gy of electron boost or not. At a median follow-up of 5\\xa0years, the \\naddition of boost reduced local failures (3.6 vs. 4.5%, p\\xa0=\\xa00.04). Despite a non- \\nsignificant increase in grade 1–2 telangiectasia (12.4 vs 5.9%), no difference was \\nobserved in the self-assessed cosmetic response between the arms [42].\\nThe second trial, the EORTC Boost Trial, randomized 5518 patients with Stage \\nI/II breast cancer to 50\\xa0Gy RT vs. 50\\xa0Gy\\xa0+\\xa016\\xa0Gy boost following lumpectomy (neg-\\native invasive margins, DCIS margins ignored). At 10-year follow-up, local failure \\nwas decreased from 10.2% to 6.2% (p\\xa0<\\xa00.0001) in those with boost, and the largest \\nbenefit was observed in patients ≤40\\xa0years (local failure decreased from 23.9 to \\n13%) [43]. Additionally, the updated results of this study with a median follow-up \\nof 17.2\\xa0years detected a significant 20-year risk reduction (from 16.4% to 12%). \\nAgain, the most obvious benefit was observed in patients ≤40\\xa0years of age (36% vs. \\n24.4%) at the expense of increased moderate/serious fibrosis rates (30.4 vs. 15%, \\np\\xa0<\\xa00.0001) [44]. Furthermore, the EORTC 22881 trial demonstrated no difference \\nin\\xa0local control between three different methods of boost application: photon, elec-\\ntron and interstitial brachytherapy [45].\\n Accelerated Partial-Breast Irradiation\\nIrradiating only the tumor-bearing quadrant of the breast after BCS instead of irra-\\ndiating the whole breast has gained much popularity over the last decade. This type \\nof breast RT is termed accelerated partial-breast irradiation (APBI). In this tech-\\nnique, the RT period is shortened considerably, and adjacent normal tissue and \\norgans as well as parts of the breast distant to the tumor bed receive a minimal dose. \\nOne disadvantage of this technique, at least in theory, is that parts of the breast dis-\\ntant to the tumor bed that harbor occult tumor foci that do not receive therapeutic \\ndoses of RT may cause higher rates of in-breast recurrences or new primaries with \\nlonger follow-up.\\nAs a result of increasing interest in this technique, many randomized trials \\nhave begun comparing APBI with whole-breast RT.\\xa0The results of some of these \\nrandomized trials have been published recently with limited follow-up [34, 35]. \\n19 Early-Stage Breast Cancer Radiotherapy 451\\nA large multi-institutional trial from the US has completed accrual, and the \\nresults are pending [39]. Despite a lack of randomized and solid evidence for the \\nsafety and efficacy of APBI, the growing popularity of APBI has driven European \\nand American RT societies to publish guidelines that may aid the selection of \\npatients who are most suitable for APBI applications [7, 8]. Researchers includ-\\ning Holland, Vaidya, Faverly, Frazier, and Rosen investigated the presence of \\ntumor foci in the other quadrants of the breast on operation specimens when a \\ntumor mass was diagnosed in one site [46–50]. In 60% of the cases, invasive but \\noccult tumor foci were identified in quadrants of the breast other than the quad-\\nrant that harbored the index tumor. These findings raised doubts about the effi-\\ncacy of APBI.\\xa0The irradiation period in APBI is shortened from 10 fractions in \\n5\\xa0days to a single fraction, which requires giving very high doses of RT in very \\nfew fractions over a very short time. This type of ultra-hypofractionation raises \\nquestions regarding the safety of APBI in terms of late sequelae and cosmesis \\n[51, 52]. In addition, radiobiological concerns about the use of a single very high \\ndose of irradiation and known mathematical models of radiobiological equiva-\\nlence have been raised [51].\\nAt this time, according to the updated guidelines published by larger RT societ-\\nies, it is considered safer to use APBI in those who are ≥50\\xa0years of age and with \\nhormone receptor-positive, BRCA 1/2-negative, T1 or Tis, node-negative disease \\nwithout lymphovascular invasion that is removed surgically with clear margins \\n(≥2\\xa0mm) or patients who have ≤2.5\\xa0cm, low to intermediate nuclear graded, screen- \\ndetected DCIS with negative margins of ≥3\\xa0 mm. By contrast, patients who are \\n≤40\\xa0years of age with positive margins and DCIS ≥3\\xa0cm should be accepted as \\n‘unsuitable candidates’ for APBI.\\xa0The results of the ongoing RTOG 0413/NSABP \\nB39 trial comparing whole-breast RT and APBI in patients with <3\\xa0cm invasive or \\nnon-invasive tumors with 1–3 positive nodes will provide more accurate data about \\nthe safety and efficiency of APBI.\\xa0The recommended dose regimens are 34\\xa0Gy in 10 \\nfractions twice daily for brachytherapy or 38.5\\xa0Gy in 10 fractions twice daily for \\nexternal beam RT [7, 8, 17].\\n Hypofractionation\\nThe rationale for hypofractionation was demonstrated by a study by Yarnold et\\xa0al. in \\nwhich the α/β ratios for the tumor and late side effects for the breast were found to \\nbe 4\\xa0Gy and 3.6\\xa0Gy, respectively [53]. Four major randomized trials investigated \\nwhether hypofractionation is as effective and safe as conventional fractionation. The \\nfirst one, the Canada Ontario Clinical Oncology Group (OCOG) trial, emphasized \\nthat a 42.5\\xa0Gy /16\\xa0Fr/22-day treatment schedule was similar to the 50\\xa0Gy/5\\xa0Fr/35- \\nday treatment schedule with no boost in terms of 10-year local invasive recurrence \\nrates (6.2 vs 6.7%) and good cosmetic results (69.8 vs 71.3%) among 1234 patients \\nstaged T1–2N0M0 who received BCS\\xa0+\\xa0level I–II ALND with no involved node or \\nmargin positivity. Although unconfirmed by other studies, an increase in\\xa0 local \\n452 K. Arslan\\xa0Ibis et al.\\nrecurrence was detected in the high-grade tumor subgroup in the hypofractionation \\narm (15.5 vs. 4.7%, p\\xa0=\\xa00.01) [54].\\nThree additional randomized trials from England compared hypofractionation \\nand conventional fractionation, all without boost treatment. A total of 1410 \\npatients with T1-3N0M0 disease treated with BCS were randomized to three dif-\\nferent dose schemas (50\\xa0Gy/25\\xa0Fr vs. 42.9\\xa0Gy/13\\xa0Fr vs. 39\\xa0Gy/13\\xa0Fr) with a total \\ntreatment time of 5\\xa0weeks in all groups. Ten-year recurrence rates were 12.1%, \\n9.6%, and 14.8%, respectively, and the difference between 42.9\\xa0Gy and 39\\xa0Gy was \\nsignificant (p\\xa0 =\\xa0 0.027) [55]. Furthermore, the other two randomized trials, \\nSTART-A (n\\xa0=\\xa02236) and -B (n=2215) included T1-3N0-1M0 patients who were \\ntreated with either BCS or modified radical mastectomy (MRM) [55, 56]. Similar \\nto the previous trial, patients were randomized to receive 50\\xa0 Gy/25\\xa0 Fr vs. \\n41.6\\xa0Gy/13\\xa0Fr vs. 39\\xa0Gy/13\\xa0Fr, all in 5\\xa0weeks in START-A whereas the randomiza-\\ntion arms were 50\\xa0Gy/25\\xa0Fr in 5\\xa0weeks and 40\\xa0Gy/15\\xa0Fr in 3\\xa0weeks in the START-B \\ntrial. The three arms were similar in START-A, whereas a survival benefit in the \\nhypofractionation group was demonstrated in the START-B trial (84 vs. 81%, \\np\\xa0=\\xa00.042) [55, 56].\\nFinally, more hypofractioned regimens (28.5 or 30\\xa0 Gy in 5\\xa0 weeks Fr vs. \\n50\\xa0 Gy/25\\xa0 Fr) were evaluated in the FAST trial, which included 729 patients \\naged ≥50\\xa0years with early-stage node-negative disease resected with negative \\nmargins. Three-year moderate/marked side effects were more common for \\n30\\xa0Gy (17.3 vs. 9.5%, p\\xa0<\\xa00.001) and 28.5\\xa0Gy (11.1 vs. 9.5%, p\\xa0=\\xa00.18) than \\n50\\xa0Gy/25\\xa0Fr [57].\\nValle et\\xa0al. compared standard fractionation and hypofractionated irradiation \\nin 8189 patients undergoing BCS with stage T1–T2 and/or N1 breast cancer or \\nDCIS in a recent systematic review and meta-analysis of 13 randomized con-\\ntrolled trials that included a highly selected group of patients who were node-\\nnegative,\\xa0 chemotherapy- naive, and without high-grade tumors.

The acute toxicity rate (n\\xa0=\\xa05 trials; RR \\n0.36; 95% CI 0.21–0.62, I2\\xa0 =\\xa0 20%) was lower in the hypofractionation arm, \\nwhereas no difference in late cosmesis was detected (RR 0.95; 95% CI 0.81–\\n1.12, I2\\xa0=\\xa054%). Similar conclusions were reached in two previous meta-analyses \\n[58, 59].\\nSince the ratio of young patients was 25% in these randomized trials, hypofrac-\\ntionated regimes are recommend with additional doses in young patients and grade \\n3 disease by\\xa0 ASTRO\\xa0 [60]. However, the use of hypofractionation in patients \\n<50\\xa0years of age with high-grade tumors and together with boost\\xa0RT\\xa0or pre- or \\npost-RT\\xa0chemotherapy\\xa0is controversial.

Although the probability of \\ninvolvement of level II LNs in the absence of level I nodes has been shown to be \\n1.2%, the risk of involvement of level II and other nodes increases up to 40% in the \\ncase of level I node metastasis [62]. Additionally, the second most common relapse \\nsite following the chest wall is the supraclavicular LN, and the reported recurrence \\nrate in the supra- and infraclavicular region is as high as 14–17% in patients with \\naxillary LN involvement and extracapsular extension [62]. By contrast, the supra-\\nclavicular fossa recurrence rate is approximately 1% in those with minimal (1–3 \\nnode) or without nodal involvement [63, 64]. The predictive factors for supracla-\\nvicular LN involvement are higher histological grade, >4 node involvement, level II \\nor III involvement, and extracapsular extension [63, 65]. The frequency of supracla-\\nvicular LN metastasis is 4.4% in those with level I involvement and ≤4 node posi-\\ntivity and increases up to 15.1% in the case of level III involvement [66]. Locoregional \\nrecurrence has been found to be 15–20% in patients <50\\xa0years of age with 1–3 node \\npositivity, grade III, or ER-negative disease, even if they received BCS, whole- \\nbreast RT and systemic therapy, thus emphasizing the importance of nodal irradia-\\ntion in this group of patients [67].\\nIdentified risk factors for “in breast LN” involvement are the presence of \\nperitumoral vascular invasion in the primary tumor on histological examination \\n(22.8%), axillary node metastases (21.9%) and >2\\xa0cm size of the primary tumor \\n(16%), whereas the only factor affecting mammary interna node metastasis is \\nperitumoral vascular invasion status in patients with negative axilla (16.4%) \\n[68].\\n Randomized Trials of\\xa0Nodal Irradiation\\nThe inclusion criteria, number of patients, follow-up times, results, significant \\npatient characteristics and results of important randomized trials investigating the \\nrole of nodal RT are summarized in Table\\xa019.1.\\n 1.

Among the 228 \\npatients, 18.9% received directed regional nodal RT using three fields: 22\\xa0in the \\nALND arm and 21\\xa0in the SLND arm [70].\\n 2.

Five-year DFS was similar between groups (84.4 vs. \\n87.8%, p\\xa0 =\\xa0 0.16), whereas side effects including sensory neuropathy (18 vs. \\n12%, p\\xa0=\\xa00.012), lymphoedema (13 vs. 3%, p\\xa0<\\xa00.0001) and motor neuropathy \\n(8 vs. 3%, p\\xa0=\\xa00.0004) were significantly increased in the ALND arm [71].\\n 3. EORTC 10981-22023 AMAROS: Patients with cT1–2, cN0, positive sentinel LN \\nmetastases were randomized to SLND\\xa0+\\xa0ALND (n\\xa0=\\xa0744) versus SLND\\xa0+\\xa0axil-\\nlary RT without ALND (n\\xa0=\\xa0681). Nonsentinel LN metastases were detected in \\n33% of patients assigned to the ALND group. Sentinel LN macrometastases \\nwere found in 59% and 62% of patients in the ALND and axillary RT groups, \\nrespectively. There was no difference between groups in terms of 5-year axillary \\nrelapse (0.43 vs. 1.19%), DFS (86.9 vs. 82.7%, p\\xa0=\\xa00.18) and OS (93.3 vs. 92.5%, \\np\\xa0 =\\xa0 0.34) whereas the incidences of lymphedema at 1\\xa0 year (28 vs. 15%, \\np\\xa0<\\xa00.0001), 3\\xa0years (23 vs. 14%, p\\xa0=\\xa00.003) and 5\\xa0years (23 vs. 11%, p\\xa0<\\xa00.0001) \\nwere increased in the ALND arm [72].\\n 4. EORTC 22922/10925: Patients with stage I, II, or III disease (centrally medially \\nlocated tumor irrespective of axillar LN involvement) or axillary LN  involvement \\n(externally located tumor) were randomized to whole-breast RT/chest-wall \\nRT\\xa0 +\\xa0 nodal RT (including medial supraclavicular and mammaria interna) \\n(n\\xa0=\\xa02002) versus whole-breast RT/chest-wall RT without nodal RT (n\\xa0=\\xa02002). \\nPatients underwent BCS or mastectomy and ALND (in case of sentinel LN \\ninvolvement during the final years of the study). Most tumors were ≤5\\xa0cm (96 vs. \\n95.8%), and the pN0 ratios were similar (44.4 vs. 45.4%). pN1a was present in \\n42.9% and 43.3%, respectively. Ten-year DFS (72.1 vs. 69.1%, p\\xa0=\\xa00.04) and \\ndistant DFS (78.0 vs. 75.0%, p\\xa0=\\xa00.02) were significantly longer in the nodal RT \\narm, whereas there was a trend in 10-year OS benefit (82.3 vs. 80.7%, p\\xa0=\\xa00.06) \\nin favor of nodal RT.\\xa0 In addition, nodal irradiation significantly decreased the \\n10-year breast cancer mortality (12.5 vs. 14.4%, p\\xa0 =\\xa0 0.02) and breast cancer \\nrelapse (19.4 vs. 22.9%, p\\xa0=\\xa00.02). The study showed that some patients with no \\naxillary LN involvement may benefit from nodal RT including the medial supra-\\nclavicular and medial mammaria interna. By contrast, pulmonary fibrosis was \\nincreased in the nodal RT arm (4.4 vs. 1.7%, p\\xa0<\\xa00.001), whereas there was no \\ndifference between groups in terms of cardiac disease (6.5 vs 5.6%, p\\xa0=\\xa00.25) [73].\\n 5. MA 20: Patients with axillary LN involvement or high-risk (≥5\\xa0cm or ≥2\\xa0cm \\nwith <10 axillary nodes removed and at least one of the following: grade 3, \\nestrogen-receptor negativity, or lymphovascular invasion) without axillary LN \\ninvolvement were randomized to whole-breast RT\\xa0+\\xa0nodal RT (including axil-\\nlary, supraclavicular and mammaria interna) (n\\xa0=\\xa0916) versus whole-breast RT \\n19 Early-Stage Breast Cancer Radiotherapy 457\\nwithout nodal RT (n\\xa0=\\xa0916). Patients with T4 or N2 disease were excluded from \\nthe study. If the sentinel LN was positive, level 1–2 dissection was performed in \\naddition to BCS.\\xa0 The distribution of positive LNs was as follows: 0 (9.6 vs. \\n9.7%), 1 (50.2 vs. 48.8%), 2 (22.8 vs. 25.4%), and 3 (11.9 vs. 10.9%). Ten-year \\nDFS (82.0 vs. 77.0%, p\\xa0=\\xa00.01) was significantly better in the nodal RT arm, \\nwhereas OS (82.8 vs. 81.8%, p\\xa0 =\\xa0 0.38) was similar between arms. The inci-\\ndences of acute pneumonitis (1.2 vs. 0.2%, p\\xa0=\\xa00.01) and lymphedema (8.4 vs \\n4.5%, p\\xa0=\\xa00.001) were higher in the nodal RT group. The most obvious DFS \\nbenefit with nodal RT was observed in pN0 patients, with a hazard ratio of 0.55 \\n(0.28–1.09) and 10-year DFS of 83.7 vs. 72.4% [25].\\n 6. French Trial: A total of 1334 patients with axillary LN involvement or central/\\nmedial located tumors, regardless of axillary LN involvement, were randomized \\nto chest-wall RT+supraclavicular\\xa0 +\\xa0 mammaria interna RT versus chest-wall \\nRT\\xa0+\\xa0supraclavicular RT without mammaria interna RT.\\xa0No benefit in 10-year \\nOS was detected with the addition of mammaria interna LN RT (62.6 vs 59.3%, \\np\\xa0=\\xa00.8) [74].\\n Conclusion\\nRadiotherapy is part of breast cancer treatment. The addition of\\xa0 RT\\xa0 to BCS \\ndecreases the risk of local recurrence by half in “insitu disease”. In invasive dis-\\nease, PMRT in patients with 4 or more lymph nodes with metastatic involvement is \\nthe standard of care. After lumpectomy, whole-breast RT\\xa0 is still considered the \\nstandard of care. In addition, boost RT\\xa0 to the tumor bed after breast-conserving \\nsurgery was shown to decrease local failure. The results of APBI\\xa0in patients with \\nlow local recurrence risk are controversial. Hypofractionation is also an appropri-\\nate therapeutic option for most patients with early breast cancer with comparable \\nlong-term toxicity profiles. A disease-free survival benefit of regional lymphatic \\nirradiation has been demonstrated in patients with high-risk features with no axil-\\nlary nodal involvement.\\nReferences\\n 1.

Randomized trials have not observed \\ndifferences in survival or locoregional control between preoperative and postop-\\nerative chemotherapy, with hazard ratios (HRs) of 0.98 (95% CI, 0.87–1.09; \\np\\xa0=\\xa00.67) and 1.12 (95% CI, 0.92–1.37; p\\xa0=\\xa00.25), respectively [2].\\n• pCR to neoadjuvant chemotherapy is associated with better survival rates com-\\npared to non-complete responders [2]. The pathological complete nodal response \\nof the axilla was 41% (95% CI, 36.7–45.3%) in a modern neoadjuvant study [3]. \\nThis research also indicates that preoperative treatment supports breast- \\nconserving surgery (BCS) due to tumor shrinkage before surgical intervention \\n(HR 0.82; 95% CI, 0.76–0.89) [2].\\n• However, many women who receive neoadjuvant chemotherapy still undergo \\nmastectomy, due to either patient preference or a lack of feasibility of BCS [1]. \\nHerein, we attempt to determine whether postmastectomy radiotherapy (PMRT) \\nand regional irradiation in the breast-conserving setting are necessary for all \\npatients undergoing systemic neoadjuvant treatment.\\nM.

Tambas et al.\\n Radiotherapy Considerations After Preoperative \\nChemotherapy\\n• The decision to prescribe radiotherapy after preoperative chemotherapy is still \\nlargely based on the initial clinical staging of the patients. Therefore, the initial \\nclinical staging information should be available prior to systemic treatment.\\n• History and physical examination, complete blood count, liver function tests, \\nalkaline phosphatase, diagnostic bilateral mammogram (ultrasound as neces-\\nsary), determination of tumor estrogen (ER)/progesterone receptor (PR), and \\nhuman epidermal growth factor receptor 2 neu (HER2) status should be routinely \\nperformed before the start of neoadjuvant chemotherapy in patients at clinical \\nstages IIA–IIB [4].\\n• Chest computed tomography (CT), abdominal CT, and bone scan can be consid-\\nered for early-stage patients with symptoms (i.e., pulmonary symptoms, abnor-\\nmal liver function tests, bone pain, or elevated alkaline phosphatase) or clinical \\nstage IIIA or higher disease. Positron emission tomography and magnetic reso-\\nnance imaging (MRI) of the breast are not considered part of the standard stag-\\ning procedure. However, MRI could be helpful in patients with mammographically \\noccult tumors [4]. MRI is also more accurate than mammography in detecting \\nresidual tumors after neoadjuvant chemotherapy but requires standardization \\n[5]. Before systemic therapy, a pathological confirmation of the axilla via fine \\nneedle aspiration biopsy is also strongly suggested [4, 6]. Radiopaque marker \\ninsertion before systemic therapy may be helpful for clarifying the lumpectomy \\narea after systemic treatment, particularly in patients with a complete tumor \\nresponse [4, 7].\\n• There is a lack of randomized data to guide decision-making for PMRT after \\npreoperative chemotherapy. Lymphatic irradiation in patients treated with breast- \\nconserving protocols after preoperative chemotherapy and who are staged ypN0 \\nis another area of controversy for which higher-level evidence is urgently needed.\\n• Our current source of information in these controversial areas are the retrospec-\\ntive series, the prospective dataset from a pooled analysis of the National Surgical \\nAdjuvant Breast and Bowel Project (NSABP) B18 and B27 trials, and the results \\nof adjuvant randomized trials. A pooled analysis of the NSABP B18 and B27 \\ntrials has been published. This analysis included cT1–3 cN0–1 patients who \\nunderwent preoperative systemic treatment. The median follow-up time was \\n11.75\\xa0years. PMRT and lymphatic irradiation in a breast-conserving setting were \\nnot allowed in this trial [8].\\n• In a recent meta meta-analysis of 4756 patient individual data from ten ran-\\ndomized trials which compared the long-term outcomes for neoadjuvant ver-\\nsus adjuvant chemotherapy in early breast cancer, found that patients who \\nreceived neoadjuvant chemotherapy had increased rate of breast-conserving \\ntherapy at an expense of increased 15-year local recurrence risk (21.4% vs. \\n15.9%, p\\xa0=\\xa00.0001) while there was no significant difference in terms of distant \\n20 Adjuvant Radiotherapy After Preoperative Chemotherapy 465\\nrecurrence or m ortality. It should be noted that none of patients received trastu-\\nzumab while most of the patients did not chemotherapy regimen containing \\ntaxane [9].\\n Prognostic Factors for\\xa0Locoregional Control After Preoperative \\nNeoadjuvant Systemic Treatment\\n• The literature suggests that the most important factors impacting the risk of LRR \\nare the initial clinical stage, the younger age at the diagnosis, the extent of resid-\\nual disease after preoperative chemotherapy, and adverse risk factors such as \\nlymphovascular space invasion (LVSI), extracapsular extension (ECE), and a \\ntriple-negative (TN) phenotype [10].\\n PMRT After Preoperative Systemic Treatment for\\xa0Initial \\nClinical Stage I\\xa0(T1 N0) Disease\\nThere are insufficient data to conclude whether PMRT is necessary for cT1N0 dis-\\nease treated with neoadjuvant chemotherapy and mastectomy.\\n PMRT After Preoperative Systemic Treatment for\\xa0Initial \\nClinical Stage IIA (T0–1 N1 or T2 N0) Disease\\n• In two retrospective studies, no locoregional failure was observed in cT2N0 \\npatients with complete pathological remission (pCR, no invasive disease in the \\npathological specimen) [11, 12]. The rates of LRR were 0–7% in patients with \\ncT1N1 that finally staged ypN0 after neoadjuvant chemotherapy, even with the \\nTN phenotype [10, 13, 14].\\n• In studies from MDACC, the LRR was 4–5% in older (>35 to 40) patients with \\nan initial cT1N1 that finally staged ypN(1–3+) after systemic chemotherapy, \\nunless there were adverse risk factors (LVSI, ECE, TN) [13, 15].\\n• In another study from MDACC, patients with cT1–2 N0–1 disease were evalu-\\nated. In the total cohort of patients who did not receive RT (n\\xa0=\\xa0181), those with \\nypN(≥4+) had the worst 5-year LRR (ypN0 1%, ypN(1–3+) 5.4%, yp(≥4+) \\n20%, p\\xa0=\\xa00.034). The presence of LVSI was also associated with worse 5-year \\nLRR (no LVSI 2% vs. LVSI(+) 15.4%, p\\xa0=\\xa00.006) [15].\\n• The 10-year incidences of LRR were 6.5%, 11.2%, and 11.1% without PMRT in \\npatients with cT1–2 N0 disease that finally staged ypN0, ypN(1–3+), or \\nypN(≥4+), respectively, in the NSABP trial [8].\\n466 M. Tambas et al.\\n PMRT After Preoperative Systemic Treatment for\\xa0Initial \\nClinical Stage IIB (T2 N1 or T3 N0) Disease\\n• Retrospective data from younger patients (<35) with stage IIB or worse disease \\ntreated with preoperative chemotherapy and mastectomy indicate that these \\npatients should also be treated with PMRT [16]. In a study from MDACC, 0% \\nLRR was observed in patients with cT2N1 disease that finally staged pCR after \\nneoadjuvant chemotherapy [11].\\n• Two retrospective studies have investigated whether PMRT is necessary for \\npatients with clinical stage II–III disease that finally staged ypN0. In a French \\nsingle-center study, PMRT had no effect on LRR-free survival (HR, 0.37; 95% \\nCI, 0.09–1.61; p\\xa0=\\xa00.18) or OS (HR, 2.06; 95% CI, 0.71–6; p\\xa0=\\xa00.18) for clinical \\nstage II or III disease staged ypN0. A trend was observed toward poorer OS \\namong patients without a pathologically complete in-breast tumor response after \\nneoadjuvant chemotherapy (HR, 6.65; 95% CI, 0.82–54.12; p\\xa0=\\xa00.076) [14].\\n• In a Korean multicenter retrospective study, the addition of PMRT was not cor-\\nrelated with a difference in DFS, LRR-free survival, or OS by multivariate analy-\\nsis for clinical stage II or III disease that finally staged ypN0. In multivariate \\nanalysis, age (≤40 vs. >40\\xa0years) and pathological T-stage (0-is vs. 1 vs. 2–4) \\nwere significant prognostic factors affecting DFS (HR, 0.35, 95% CI, 0.135–\\n0.928; p\\xa0=\\xa00.035 and HR 2.22, 95% CI 1.074–4.604; p\\xa0=\\xa00.031, respectively) [17].\\n• The 10-year incidences of LRR were 0%, 10.8%, 14.4%, and 19.5% without \\nPMRT in patients with cT1–2 N1 disease that finally staged pCR, ypN0 (no \\nbreast pCR), ypN(1–3+), or ypN(>4+), respectively, in the NSABP trial [8].\\n• Another study from MDACC evaluated patients with cT3N0 disease treated with \\nneoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) and mastectomy. Although all patients were \\nclinically determined to have no nodal disease prior to NAC, 45% had pathologi-\\ncally confirmed disease in the lymph node. The 5-year LRR rate differed signifi-\\ncantly between patients who received PMRT and those who did not: 4% (95% \\nCI, 1–9%) with PMRT vs. 24% (95% CI, 10–39%) without PMRT (p\\xa0<\\xa00.001) \\n[18]. Although the LRR rate was 0% in patients with cT3N0 disease that finally \\nstaged pCR after preoperative chemotherapy, MDACC suggests PMRT for all \\npatients with cT3N0 disease [1, 11, 13, 18].\\n• The 10-year incidences of LRR were 6.2%, 11.8%, 10.6%, and 17.6% without \\nPMRT in patients with cT3N0 disease that finally staged pCR, ypN0 (no breast \\npCR), ypN(1–3+), or ypN(>4+), respectively, in the NSABP trial [8].\\n PMRT After Preoperative Systemic Treatment for\\xa0Initial \\nClinical Stage IIIA (T3 N1 or T0–3 N2) Disease\\n• The role of PMRT in cases of pCR in patients with clinical stage III disease \\nwas evaluated at MDACC.\\xa0The 10-year LRR rate for patients with stage III \\ndisease was significantly improved with radiation therapy (7.3%\\xa0±\\xa03.5% with \\nvs. 33.3%\\xa0 ±\\xa0 15.7% without; p\\xa0 =\\xa0 0.04). In this cohort, the 10-year distant \\n20 Adjuvant Radiotherapy After Preoperative Chemotherapy 467\\nmetastasis-f ree survival (DMFS) rate was 87.9%\\xa0±\\xa04.6% for irradiated patients \\nand 40.7%\\xa0±\\xa015.5% for non-irradiated patients (p\\xa0=\\xa00.0006). The 10-year OS \\nrate was 77.3%\\xa0±\\xa06% for irradiated patients and 33.3%\\xa0±\\xa014% for non-irradi-\\nated patients [11].\\n• The 10-year incidences of LRR were 0%, 9.2%, 14.7%, and 27.2% without \\nPMRT in patients with cT3N1 disease that finally staged pCR, ypN0 (no breast \\npCR), ypN(1–3+), or ypN(>4+), respectively, in the NSABP trial [8].\\n• The indications for PMRT in stage III patients achieving pCR varies between \\ninstitutions. MDACC suggests PMRT for all clinical stage III patients [11]. If \\npCR is achieved in patients with cT3N1 disease, aged >40\\xa0years, and with no TN \\nhistology, PMRT is not necessary, according to NSABP data [8]. Clearly, valida-\\ntion is needed for this controversial topic [10].\\n PMRT After Preoperative Systemic Treatment for\\xa0Initial \\nClinical Stage IIIB (T4 N0–2) Disease\\n• The 5-year LRR risk in clinical stage IIIB patients treated with neoadjuvant \\nchemotherapy and without PMRT was 42% in a retrospective study from \\nMDACC [18].\\n Lymphatic Irradiation After Preoperative Systemic Treatment \\nand\\xa0Breast-Conserving Surgery\\n• The complete nodal pathological response rate in the axilla was 41% (95%CI, \\n36.7–45.3) in a modern neoadjuvant study [3]. This encouraging result questions \\nthe necessity of axillary lymph node dissection for cN1 patients with good clini-\\ncal response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy. However, the false-negative rate of \\nsentinel lymph node biopsy after neoadjuvant chemotherapy remains high \\n(12.6%), and studies are needed to decrease axillary surgical interventions, par-\\nticularly in patients with cN1 disease and a good clinical response to neoadjuvant \\nchemotherapy [19].\\n• The contribution of lymphatic irradiation to DFS and possibly to survival \\nimprovement has been demonstrated in modern adjuvant studies such as NCI-C \\nMA20 and EORTC 22922/10925 [20, 21]. How this information will or should \\nbe applied in the neoadjuvant setting is not clear. There is no consensus on the \\noptimal management of regional radiotherapy in patients receiving neoadjuvant \\nchemotherapy and axillary dissection.\\n• The role of lymphatic irradiation in clinical stage II–III disease was investigated \\nin a French retrospective study. These researchers compared the outcomes of \\npatients with pN0 status after neoadjuvant chemotherapy and BCS according to \\nwhether they received lymphatic irradiation. No improvement in the rates of \\nLRR or survival was observed for nodal irradiation. All patients with initially \\n468 M. Tambas et al.\\npositive axillary cytology received lymphatic radiotherapy, and 83% of patients \\nin the no-lymphatic-RT arm had cN0 disease in that study [14].\\n• The risk of regional recurrence was less than 10% in the NSABP trial after BCS \\nand breast-only RT.\\xa0 Age and the residual disease burden in the axilla had an \\nimpact on the 10-year incidence of LRR in the NSABP trial [8]. The 10-year \\nincidences of LRR (<50\\xa0years vs. ≥50\\xa0years) were 12% vs. 5.9% and 15.6% vs. \\n11.3% with breast-only RT in patients with cN0 disease that finally staged \\nypN(1–3+) and ypN(>4+), respectively. The 10-year incidences of LRR \\n(<50\\xa0years vs. ≥50\\xa0years) were 21.1% vs. 11.4% and 24% vs. 19.6% with breast- \\nonly RT in patients with cN+ disease that finally staged ypN(1–3+) and ypN(>4+), \\nrespectively [8].\\n• There are no conclusive data as to whether lymphatic irradiation can be omitted \\nin patients with clinical stage N2 disease that finally staged pCR after neoadju-\\nvant chemotherapy.\\n Radiotherapy Fields After Preoperative Systemic \\nChemotherapy\\n• Whole-breast radiotherapy is the standard of practice in patients treated with \\nneoadjuvant chemotherapy and BCS.\\xa0If radiotherapy is indicated in the postmas-\\ntectomy setting, the chest wall should be treated. In most studies from MDACC, \\nfull lymphatic irradiation (mammaria interna, supra, level 3, and axillary apex) \\nwas also performed [13, 16].\\n• In general, there is no controversy about whether patients with initial clinical \\nstage cN0–1 disease that finally staged ypN(4+) should receive lymphatic radio-\\ntherapy including the undissected portion of the axilla (i.e., supraclavicular and \\nlevel 3). Lymphatic radiotherapy fields may vary between institutions in patients \\nwith clinical stage II disease that finally staged ypN(1–3+) [22].\\n• PMRT could be omitted for stage II patients with pCR who are not TN and who \\nare >40\\xa0years. All patients with stage II disease but who have had residual dis-\\nease in the axilla should receive PMRT.\\xa0One institution is using a supra-level 3 \\nfield for stage II patients with no residual axillary cancer but no pCR at the \\ntumor, particularly for younger patients who have no reasonable options for \\nadjuvant systemic therapy (i.e., estrogen receptor (−) and Her-2 Neu(−)).\\n• All patients with stage III disease should receive PMRT [22]. The decision to use \\nlymphatic radiotherapy in patients with stage III disease should be based on the \\npathological status of the axilla, but in a retrospective study from Florida, the \\nomission of the supraclavicular field was significantly associated with LRR by \\nmultivariate analysis (HR 3.39; p\\xa0=\\xa00.024) [23].\\n• There are insufficient data examining the omission of radiotherapy in patients \\nwith cT4 or cN2 disease. Thus, PMRT with whole lymphatics should be advised \\nfor these patients.\\n20 Adjuvant Radiotherapy After Preoperative Chemotherapy 469\\n Future Directions\\n• Clearly, there is a need for randomized studies to assess the safe omission of \\nPMRT and regional radiotherapy in women with a good response to chemother-\\napy without compromising breast cancer outcomes. In the NSABP B51/\\nRadiotherapy Oncology Group (RTOG) 1304 study, patients with involved axil-\\nlary nodes (histologically confirmed) are treated with neoadjuvant chemother-\\napy. Those who are node negative at subsequent mastectomy are randomly \\nassigned to\\xa0±\\xa0postmastectomy RT (PMRT) to the chest wall and regional nodes. \\nSimilarly, patients who undergo subsequent breast conservation surgery and \\nwhose nodes have become negative after preoperative chemotherapy will be ran-\\ndomly assigned to breast RT\\xa0±\\xa0regional nodal RT [24].\\n• An analysis of sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) after systemic chemother-\\napy in patients with cN1 disease has been published (Z1071 study) [19]. The \\nfalse-negative rate after the SLNB procedures was 12.6% (90% Bayesian cred-\\nible interval, 9.85–16.05%) in the entire group. Both the use of dual-agent map-\\nping (blue dye and radiolabeled colloid) and the recovery of more than 2 SLNs \\nwere associated with a lower likelihood of false-negative SLN findings (9.1% \\nfor ≥3 SLNs). According to the results of the AMAROS trial, both axillary dis-\\nsection and lymphatic radiotherapy had the same rates of disease control but \\nfewer side effects with RT in patients with positive SLNB cT1–2 N0 disease \\n[25]. For women who receive neoadjuvant chemotherapy and whose lymph \\nnodes remain pathologically positive after surgery, regional radiotherapy is \\nindicated.\\n• However, the ALLIANCE (Alliance for Clinical Trials in Oncology) A011202 \\nphase III clinical trial (NCT01901094) has been designed to answer whether \\naxillary node dissection improves the rate of breast cancer recurrence over that \\nobserved with SLNB alone when regional radiotherapy is delivered. If SLNB \\nbecomes a standard approach in the neoadjuvant setting, some cN1 patients \\ncould be treated with SLNB and axillary radiotherapy without axillary dissec-\\ntion. Clearly, more studies are also needed in this area [26].\\nReferences\\n 1.

In this chapter, RT after neoadjuvant \\nchemotherapy (NACT) and RT in unresectable disease, locally recurrent disease, and \\nmetastatic disease are discussed.\\n Radiotherapy After Neoadjuvant Chemotherapy\\nNo randomized trial data exist to define which women will benefit from postmastec-\\ntomy radiotherapy (PMRT) after NACT.\\xa0Retrospective data suggest that both clini-\\ncal stage at presentation and response to NACT could be used to indicate RT for \\nthese patients [1].\\nPatients with clinical stage III disease and lymph node involvement at the time of \\nsurgery are routinely given PMRT.\\xa0In clinical stage II disease, PMRT is considered \\nfor those with lymph node involvement at the time of surgery or with features sug-\\ngesting high-risk disease, such as triple-negative disease, partial response to chemo-\\ntherapy, low hormone receptor levels, T3 tumor, close surgical margin, diffuse \\nlymphovascular space involvement, or very young age.

In \\nanother ongoing trial, Alliance 011202, patients with positive sentinel lymph node \\nafter NACT are randomly assigned to receive either level 1–2 axillary lymph node \\ndissection (ALND) and nodal irradiation, including undissected axilla, supracla-\\nvicular and internal mammary nodes, or full axilla, supraclavicular and internal \\nmammary node irradiation without ALND.\\xa0This trial will establish if ALND may be \\nomitted or not in this group of patients [4]. Until then, RT should be applied accord-\\ning to pre-chemotherapy clinical disease stage.\\n Patients with\\xa0Unresectable Disease\\nIn non-metastatic patients whose tumors remain unresectable after chemotherapy, \\nRT may be administered to all pre-chemotherapy tumor extensions followed by \\nboost to the residual sites. The initial RT dose of 50\\xa0Gy with an additional boost \\ndose of 10–26\\xa0Gy for the organ at risk may be an appropriate approach. However, \\npatients should be monitored at 45–50\\xa0Gy to assess suitability for surgery [5–7].\\n Radiotherapy in\\xa0Locally Recurrent Disease\\nApproximately one third of recurrences occur as local relapse in breast cancer. The \\nlocal recurrence rate is reported to be 3–14% after BCS+RT but 8–13% following \\nmastectomy plus RT [8, 9]. When breast cancer recurs only on the chest wall after \\nmastectomy or as in-breast recurrence after breast conserving surgery (BCS), \\nintense local–regional therapies including surgical resection alone, surgical resec-\\ntion followed by RT, RT alone (when surgery is not applicable), concurrent chemo-\\nradiotherapy or RT combined with hyperthermia should be administered.\\nSurgical excision with negative margins not only reduces the necessary total RT \\ndose but also increases disease control rates. While complete excision alone results \\nin a 5-year disease free survival (DFS) rate of 35% [10], RT addition to surgery \\nincreases local control rates up to 60–77% [11, 12]. If not previously administered, \\nchest wall and regional lymphatic irradiation should be administered in case of local \\nrecurrence after mastectomy [13]. In previously irradiated patients, superficial \\nrecurrences can be irradiated with interstitial brachytherapy or using a mold. \\nPhotons or electron RT may be used according to the dose to organs at risk from \\nprevious irradiation. Although the reported case series are inhomogeneous, the local \\ncontrol rates are in the range of 62–89%, at the expense of skin reactions, rib frac-\\nture and radiation pneumonitis [14, 15].\\n21 Advanced-Stage Breast Cancer Radiotherapy 475\\nFollowing local recurrence after primary BCS\\xa0+\\xa0RT, second BCS alone results \\nin\\xa0 local recurrence rates of 7–19% [16, 17]. Thus, partial breast irradiation with \\ntumor bed boost has been applied at several centers. The reported local control rates \\nare in the range of 77–93% [18, 19]. Re-irradiation after second BCS has been \\nreported to have similar effectiveness as electrons, conventional external RT, \\n interstitial brachytherapy, MammoSite and IORT [17, 19–21]. Attention should be \\npaid to possible skin ulceration, brachial plexus injury, osteonecrosis, rib fractures \\nand cardiomyopathy in chest wall re-irradiation at doses above 100\\xa0Gy [22].\\nIn patients with prior irradiation who are considered to tolerate additional RT, \\ncombination therapies with chemotherapy or hyperthermia may be feasible options \\nsince recurrent tumors are generally radioresistant. A meta-analysis of hyperthermia \\nand RT combination studies showed improved complete response rates (59% vs. \\n41%) compared with RT alone, with no survival benefit (both 18\\xa0 months) [23]. \\nSimilar results were reported in a prospective randomized trial by Jones et\\xa0al. (com-\\nplete response 68.2% vs. 23.5%, p\\xa0=\\xa00.02), with no OS advantage [24]. In a more \\nrecent meta-analysis by Datta et\\xa0al., the complete response was higher in the com-\\nbination arm compared with RT alone (n\\xa0=\\xa0627, 60.2% vs 38.1%, p\\xa0<\\xa00.0001) with \\na mean RT dose of 38.2\\xa0Gy (range 26–60\\xa0Gy); mean acute and late grade 3–4 toxici-\\nties for combination therapy were 14.4% and 5.2%, respectively [25]. Furthermore, \\na complete response rate as high as 80% was reported with the combination of \\nthermo-chemoradiotherapy [26].\\n Radiotherapy in\\xa0Metastatic Disease\\nAlthough there are no prospective randomized trials showing that local RT provides \\na survival benefit in patients with metastatic breast cancer (MBC), a recently pub-\\nlished literature review analyzed 27 retrospective studies with more than 33,000 \\nMBC patients. The role of RT was mentioned in 14 (52%) of the studies, and 5 of 6 \\nthat examined RT effects separately demonstrated a benefit of local RT [27]. Patients \\nwho are expected to have good survival prognosis may be candidates for local RT \\ncombined with surgery. Still, the role of RT in these patients remains to be clarified \\nin further randomized prospective studies.\\nThe percentage of patients with oligometastatic disease among breast cancer \\npatients is not fully known. However, when prospective trials of first-line chemo-\\ntherapy regimens were analyzed in terms of oligometastasis prevalence, approxi-\\nmately 50% of patients who were candidates for first-line MBC trials had ≤2 \\nmetastatic sites, and 75% had ≤4 [28–33]. When early-stage patients progressed \\nto metastatic disease, approximately 17% presented with 1–5 metastatic sites; \\namong these patients, oligometastasis was more common than in asymptomatic \\npatients (26.7 vs. 14.5%, p\\xa0=\\xa00.022) [34]. Most of these patients may be more suit-\\nable for ablative RT than surgery due to their medical comorbidities; the lack of \\nrequired interval time for postsurgical recovery, which causes systemic treatment \\ninterruptions; patient preference; or unresectable metastases. In addition, the \\n476 K. Arslan Ibis and S. Kucucuk\\ndetermination of the subgroup that will benefit most from stereotactic ablative RT \\n(SART) is a challenging issue, although patients with only bone metastasis seem \\nto have improved outcomes [35].\\nThe biological effects of SART can be summarized as follows: (1) suspension of \\nprogression of the irradiated metastatic focus, (2) prevention of new seeding of \\nmetastases from the irradiated site to other regions, and (3) inhibition of the progres-\\nsion of unirradiated sites via the abscopal effect [36, 37]. The control rates of SART \\nare promising and reported to be 67–95% [38–40]. In addition, breast cancer patients \\nhave been shown to benefit from SART much more than patients with other types of \\ncancer, as evidenced by 2-year PFS and 6-year OS rates of 36 vs. 13% and 47 vs. \\n9%, respectively. Furthermore, local control outcomes were also higher in breast \\ncancer patients (87 vs. 74%) [41].\\nThe reported 2-year local control rates and toxicities of SART according to meta-\\nstatic sites irradiated are as follows: 80% for lung metastasis (5% rate of grade ≥3 \\nside effects), with a 2-year survival rate of 50%; 57–92% for liver metastases \\n(uncommon liver toxicities) [38, 39]. Available data are derived from retrospective \\nstudies, and ongoing phase II and randomized studies will provide more evidence \\nabout the role of SART in MBC patients [40].\\nOne of the most common metastatic sites in SART is the brain, since 10–15% of \\nMBC develops symptomatic brain metastasis [42, 43]. No obvious benefit has been \\nshown for early detection, and screening for brain metastasis during the routine \\nfollow-up program of breast cancer patients is not recommended [44]. The prognos-\\ntic factors for OS following SART for brain metastasis are triple-negative histology \\nand progressive extracranial metastasis [45]. Since the ratio of breast cancer among \\nphase III randomized trials of SART for brain metastasis is 6.8–11.7%, further stud-\\nies including only breast cancer patients are warranted [46]. However, a systematic \\nreview of the literature comparing surgery, whole-brain RT (WBRT), single-dose \\nstereotactic radiosurgery (SRS), and their combination [47–50] indicated the \\nfollowing:\\n 1. SRS\\xa0+\\xa0WBRT is superior to WBRT in terms of local control in patients with ≤4 \\nbrain metastases and good performance status.\\n 2. SRS\\xa0+\\xa0WBRT is superior to WBRT in term of survival in patients with single \\nbrain metastases [51].\\n 3. SRS is equal to SRS\\xa0+\\xa0WBRT in terms of survival (one randomized trial showed \\nsuperior survival with SRS alone) [52].\\n 4. SRS alone is superior to WBRT alone in terms of survival benefit in patients with \\n≤3 brain metastases.\\n 5. Further studies are warranted to determine the optimal dose for SRS alone and \\nWBRT\\xa0+\\xa0SRS.\\n 6. SRS\\xa0+\\xa0WBRT is equal to surgery\\xa0+\\xa0WBRT in terms of survival.\\n 7. SRS may be used instead of surgery\\xa0+\\xa0WBRT.\\n 8. Surgery\\xa0+\\xa0WBRT is superior to both WBRT alone and surgery alone in patients \\nwith good performance status and limited extracranial metastases.\\n21 Advanced-Stage Breast Cancer Radiotherapy 477\\n 9. Surgery is superior to SRS alone in patients with tumors that are larger (>3\\xa0cm) \\nor cause a 1-cm midline shift.\\nIn addition, retrospective and prospective data support increased local control \\nand survival for the application of SRS to the surgical bed compared to WBRT.\\xa0SRS \\nof the surgical cavity in patients who have had complete resection of one, two, or \\nthree brain metastases significantly lowers local recurrence compared with that \\nnoted for observation alone [12-month freedom from local recurrence was 43% \\n(95% CI 31–59) in the observation group and 72% (60–87) in the SRS group (haz-\\nard ratio 0.46; p\\xa0=\\xa00.015)] [53]. Thus, the use of SRS after brain metastasis resection \\ncould be an alternative to WBRT.\\nRegarding bone metastases, radiological assessment is needed to define whether \\na pathological fracture has occurred or is likely to happen. In this case, RT may be \\nadministered following surgical stabilization. If surgical intervention is not feasible, \\nRT should be performed. In case of spinal cord compression, surgical decompres-\\nsion is recommended. If decompression/stabilization is not applicable, immediate \\nRT should be planned [54].\\nReferences\\n 1.

Breast cancer is a heteroge-\\nneous disease comprising several molecular subtypes, which are commonly extrap-\\nolated into clinical subtypes based on receptor status [2]. The specific receptors that \\nare assessed in standard clinical practice are the estrogen receptor (ER), progester-\\none receptor (PR), and human epidermal growth factor 2-neu (HER2) receptor. \\nThese receptors are both prognostic but also predictive of response to targeted ther-\\napy; thus, when metastasis is suspected, it is crucial to perform a biopsy not only to \\nconfirm recurrent disease but also to confirm receptor status [3]. In addition, tissue \\navailability may increase clinical trial access because many studies now assess tar-\\ngetable molecular aberrancies. Figure\\xa0 22.1 outlines the therapeutic approach to \\nwomen with ER/PR+ and HER2-negative or ‘triple-negative’ metastatic breast can-\\ncer (MBC); the evidence supporting these treatment strategies is discussed below.\\nS.

The benefit of \\npalliative local breast surgery to women presenting with stage IV disease remains unclear. This \\nlocal therapy should be considered only after a response to initial systemic therapy. Notably, some \\nstudies suggest that surgery is only valuable if performed with the same attention to detail (e.g., \\nattaining clear margins and addressing disease in the axilla) as in patients with early-stage disease. \\nIf bone disease is present, add denosumab, zoledronic acid, ibandronic acid, or pamidronate. \\nb“Anti-programmed death-1” (PD-1)/“Programmed death ligand” (PDL-1) antibodies were found \\nto be effective alone or with taxanes in patients with triple-negative tumors. cThe major determi-\\nnants of the treatment plan include the number of lesions, extent of visceral involvement, receptor \\nstatus of the primary lesion, sites of recurrence and metastasis, and previous response to endocrine \\ntreatment. The addition of CD4/6 inhibitors to the first- or second-choice endocrine treatment was \\nfound to be effective in randomized clinical trials. The combination of exemestane, tamoxifen or \\nfulvestrant with everolimus can be considered for patients who progressed within 12\\xa0months on a \\nnon-steroidal AI or on tamoxifen at any time. Fulvestrant can be used as the first choice in de novo \\nmetastatic disease not previously treated with any endocrine treatment\\n Systemic Chemotherapy of\\xa0HER2-Negative Metastatic Breast \\nCancer\\nConsiderable advances have been made in the treatment of certain subtypes of \\nbreast cancer, such as HER2-positive disease. In this subtype, targeted therapies \\nagainst HER2 have changed the clinical outcome for patients with metastatic dis-\\nease by providing them with several effective therapies that can extend survival by \\nmany years [4]. The ER- and PR-positive subtypes also have several targeted thera-\\npies available that use endocrine therapies; however, when the disease becomes \\nmetastatic, all patients eventually develop endocrine resistance and eventually \\nrequire cytotoxic chemotherapy [5]. Patients with ER-, PR-, and HER2-negative \\ntumors, so-called triple-negative breast cancers (TNBCs), biologically tend to dis-\\nplay an aggressive phenotype, currently do not have targeted therapy options as a \\n22 Systemic Treatment of\\xa0HER2-Negative Metastatic Breast Cancer 485\\nstandard of care, and have only a limited number of cytotoxic agents available to \\ntreat their disease [6]. This chapter narrates and expands on some of the recent \\nefforts in drug development for HER2-negative MBC, and the current standard of \\ncare of these different subtypes of breast cancer is summarized.\\n Treatment of\\xa0ER/PR-Positive HER2-Negative Metastatic \\nBreast Cancer\\nTwo-thirds of all women diagnosed with breast cancer have a disease that is ER/PR+. \\nThese tumors are highly responsive to anti-estrogen therapeutic strategies. However, \\ndespite widespread use of hormonal adjuvant therapy, a quarter of women with ER+ \\ndisease will relapse. In this situation, a determination regarding further hormonal \\ntherapy versus chemotherapy as the next step must be made. Patients whose disease \\nis viscerally relatively ‘low’-volume, bone/soft tissue-predominant, and asymptom-\\natic are reasonable candidates for upfront endocrine therapy. Table\\xa022.1 outlines the \\ntreatment strategies for women with ER+ MBC.\\xa0The current standart practice for \\nthese patients will be discussed in Chap. 24.\\n Tamoxifen, Fulvestrant, and\\xa0Ovarian Suppression\\nThe current practice for premenopausal women with MBC previously unexposed to \\nhormone blockade is treatment in the first-line setting with tamoxifen as initial \\nendocrine therapy or with aromatase inhibitor (AI) therapy in combination with \\novarian suppression (via oophorectomy, radiation, or a GnRH agonist). Ovarian \\nradiation is a less optimal mode of ablation as the success rate and time to ablation \\nvary, in contrast to the irreversible and immediate ablation afforded by oophorec-\\ntomy. An Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group study examining adjuvant estrogen \\nblockade in premenopausal patients randomly assigned patients to tamoxifen mono-\\ntherapy versus tamoxifen plus ovarian ablation via radiotherapy, oophorectomy, or \\nGnRH agonists [7]. The trial was closed early for inadequate accrual; however, 75% \\nof those undergoing radiotherapy achieved estradiol or follicle-stimulating hormone \\n(FSH) levels consistent with those of ovarian ablation at 6\\xa0months after completing \\n20\\xa0Gy in 10 fractions. Further evidence supporting the need for ovarian suppression \\nin addition to tamoxifen is lacking; data pertaining to premenopausal women in the \\nadjuvant setting suggest that the combination of goserelin and tamoxifen is not \\nsuperior to tamoxifen alone [8].\\nFulvestrant (Faslodex; AstraZeneca, London, UK) is a synthetic ER antagonist \\nthat downregulates and degrades ERs by competitively binding them without \\ntamoxifen’s partial agonist effect. Intramuscular injections of fulvestrant were com-\\npared with those of tamoxifen in a large randomized trial to determine whether the \\nabsence of the partial agonist properties of fulvestrant improved outcomes among \\n486 S.

The latter \\nstudy also established the current standard dose of fulvestrant at 500\\xa0mg monthly \\ndue to its superior efficacy compared with 250\\xa0mg monthly [9]. Subsequently, the \\nFALCON trial, a phase III study that randomly assigned women who were endo-\\ncrine therapy naïve to fulvestrant (500\\xa0mg monthly) versus anastrozole (1\\xa0mg daily), \\nshowed a comparable clinical benefit rate (CBR) and a longer PFS for fulvestrant, \\nsuggesting its potential as an alternative to AIs as a first-line endocrine agent in \\npostmenopausal women [11].\\n Aromatase Inhibitors (AI): Exemestane, Anastrozole, \\nand\\xa0Letrozole\\nEstrogen production in postmenopausal women is derived from the peripheral aro-\\nmatization of androgens. Inhibition of aromatase is consequently a cornerstone of \\nhormonal blockade in the management of postmenopausal breast cancer [12]. These \\ndrugs cannot be used alone safely in premenopausal women without concomitant \\novarian suppression or ablation since aromatase inhibition in the setting of func-\\ntional ovaries will lead to ovarian hyperstimulation. AIs currently in use include \\nanastrozole (AstraZeneca, London, UK), letrozole (Novartis, East Hanover, NJ, \\nUSA), and exemestane (Pfizer Inc, New\\xa0York, NY, USA). An analysis of two large \\nrandomized trials showed that anastrozole was at least equivalent to tamoxifen in the \\nfirst-line setting in postmenopausal women who were endocrine therapy-naïve in the \\nmetastatic setting; unplanned subgroup analysis restricted to patients with known \\nhormone receptor positivity demonstrated a superior TTP for anastrozole [13]. \\nLetrozole has also been directly compared with tamoxifen in the first-line setting \\namong women with MBC, revealing a similar increase in TTP [14]. Consequently, \\nanastrozole and letrozole, non-steroidal AIs, are first-line endocrine options in post-\\nmenopausal MBC.\\nExemestane, in contrast to the non-steroidals in this class, is a steroidal AI that \\nirreversibly inhibits aromatase. In women who progressed on tamoxifen, exemes-\\ntane resulted in prolonged TTP and OS compared with megestrol [15, 16]. In addi-\\ntion to utility in the second-line setting, exemestane yielded a significant early \\nimprovement in TTP compared with tamoxifen in the first-line setting, although \\nafter a longer follow-up, the two drugs were found to have comparable efficacy [15]. \\nThere is a paucity of data comparing AIs directly to each other in the metastatic set-\\nting; however, extrapolation from a small trial showed that exemestane and anastro-\\nzole produced similar RRs among postmenopausal women who had MBC and who \\nwere tamoxifen refractory [17].\\n488 S. Bayraktar and A. Aydiner\\n Progestins: Megestrol\\nProgestins such as megestrol acetate (MA) are some of the oldest compounds used \\nin the treatment of MBC and indirectly reduce serum estrogen levels by reducing \\nandrogen levels. Although the use of these agents has dropped dramatically since \\nthe introduction of AIs and GNRH agonists, there are data demonstrating efficacy of \\nthese agents in the MBC setting. Although randomized trials comparing MA and \\ntamoxifen show comparable RRs and TTP, ultimately tamoxifen remains preferable \\nto MA because of its toxicity profile. Analyses comparing AI and MA have shown \\nthat anastrozole confers a survival advantage over MA, whereas letrozole confers an \\nimproved RR and time to treatment failure [12]. After failure on first- and second-\\nline therapies, data suggest that the use of MA as a second- or third-line therapy is \\nreasonable for ‘durable’ disease stabilization but not with the goal of response [18].\\n Treatment of\\xa0ER/PR-Positive HER2-Negative Endocrine- \\nRefractory Metastatic Breast Cancer\\n Mechanisms of\\xa0Endocrine Therapy Resistance in\\xa0ER+ Breast \\nCancer\\nAcquired resistance (defined as recurrence at least 6–12\\xa0months after completion of \\nadjuvant therapy or disease progression more than 6\\xa0months after endocrine therapy \\ninitiated in the metastatic setting) and occasionally primary resistance (recurrence \\neither during adjuvant therapy or within 6–12\\xa0months of completion of adjuvant \\ntherapy or disease progression less than 6 months after treatment in the metastatic \\nsetting) to antiestrogen therapy is inevitable in patients with ER+ metastatic breast \\ncancer (MBC).\\nA variety of mechanisms have been implicated in primary and acquired resis-\\ntance to endocrine agents (Sidebar 22.1). Below we review some strategies for over-\\ncoming endocrine therapy resistance.\\nSidebar 22.1 Mechanisms of resistance to endocrine agents\\nPrimary resistance\\n• Receptor tyrosine kinase/growth factor signaling pathway\\n• FGFR amplification\\n• EGFR/ERBB2 mutations\\n• Cell cycle control signaling pathway\\n• Cyclin D1 amplification or expression\\n• MYC amplification and overexpression\\n• Hormone signaling pathway\\n• Loss of ERα\\n• Post-translational modification of ERα\\n• Expression of ER coactivation/corepression factors\\n22 Systemic Treatment of\\xa0HER2-Negative Metastatic Breast Cancer 489\\nAcquired resistance\\n• PI3K/AKT1/MTOR signaling pathway\\n• PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway activation\\n• Mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase pathway\\n• MAPK/ERK pathway activation\\n• Hormone signaling pathway\\n• ESR1 mutations\\n• Changes in the tumor microenvironment\\n mTOR Inhibitors\\nThe PI3K–Akt–mTOR signaling pathway is a major intracellular signaling pathway \\nthat plays a significant role in cell growth and proliferation and has been implicated \\nin resistance to endocrine therapy [19]. The Breast Cancer Trials of Oral \\nEverolimus-2 (BOLERO-2) study [20] demonstrated that inhibiting mTOR with \\neverolimus in combination with exemestane improved progression-free survival \\n(PFS) compared with exemestane alone in patients with ER-positive MBC previ-\\nously treated with a nonsteroidal AI (NSAI). However, the phase III HORIZON trial \\n[21] found no survival benefit of combining temsirolimus with letrozole in the first- \\nline setting, suggesting that mTOR signaling may have a specific role in acquired \\nresistance to endocrine therapy. Although the BOLERO-2 study combination has \\nbecome a standard of care in patients whose disease has progressed after treatment \\nwith a NSAI, it is unknown if everolimus has meaningful single-agent activity that \\ncould explain the results [22, 23]. Several ongoing trials will better define the role \\nof everolimus in advanced disease: BOLERO-6 (NCT01783444), a phase II trial \\ncomparing exemestane/everolimus to capecitabine in ER+/HER2-negative disease \\nrefractory to AI, and BOLERO-4 (NCT01698918), a phase II single-arm study eval-\\nuating the role of everolimus as a first-line treatment. Everolimus is also being eval-\\nuated in the adjuvant setting in two studies using two different approaches: (1) \\nSWOG1207 (NCT01674140), which will randomly assign high-risk premenopausal \\nand postmenopausal patients to add everolimus or placebo to their standard adju-\\nvant endocrine therapy; and (2) NCT01805271, which will evaluate the addition of \\neverolimus to adjuvant endocrine therapy in high-risk ER+/HER2-negative patients \\nwith breast cancer who remain disease free after at least 1\\xa0year of treatment.\\n PI3K Inhibitors\\nPI3K inhibitors consist of pan-PI3K targeting all class I isoforms, isoform-specific \\nPI3K inhibitors, and dual PI3K/mTOR inhibitors. Compounds may also display \\ndifferential activity for wild-type and mutant PI3K proteins. The response rates for \\nsingle-agent PI3K inhibitors are far below those for other kinase inhibitors in other \\ncancer types (such as EGFR, ALK, or BRAF inhibitors).\\n490 S. Bayraktar and A. Aydiner\\nBuparlisib (BKM120) is a pan-PI3K inhibitor with potent activity against mutant \\nPI3Kα [24]. Early-phase trials of buparlisib plus endocrine therapy reported activity \\nand a manageable safety profile characterized by transaminitis, hyperglycemia, \\ndiarrhea, and mood disorders (anxiety, depression, irritability) [25]. The random-\\nized phase III BELLE-2 trial studied fulvestrant 500\\xa0mg plus buparlisib 100\\xa0mg \\ndaily or placebo in postmenopausal MBC progressing on AIs [26]. Buparlisib \\nincreased the median PFS by 1.9\\xa0months (6.9\\xa0months vs. 5.0\\xa0months, p\\xa0<\\xa00.001). \\nFor patients with PI3K/AKT pathway activation (defined as PIK3CA mutation or \\nPTEN loss, assayed in the archival primary tumor for the majority of patients), there \\nwas no difference in the benefit of buparlisib. However, in the subset of patients in \\nwhom PIK3CA mutation was assessed by circulating tumor DNA at trial entry, \\nbuparlisib plus fulvestrant increased PFS in PIK3CA mutant cases compared with \\nfulvestrant alone (7\\xa0months vs. 3.2\\xa0months; HR, 0.56; p\\xa0<\\xa00.001).\\nUsing the same treatment arms as BELLE-2, the phase III BELLE-3 trial enrolled \\nAI-experienced patients with disease progression in the past 30\\xa0days on an mTOR \\ninhibitor plus endocrine therapy [27]. The median PFS for patients in the buparlisib \\narm was 3.9\\xa0months versus 1.8\\xa0months for fulvestrant/placebo, and the 6-month \\nPFS rates were 30.6% and 20.1%, respectively. Of the 349 patients for whom \\nPIK3CA mutation status from circulating tumor DNA was available, 147 had muta-\\ntions in the gene. Among those with PIK3CA mutations, PFS was 4.7\\xa0months in the \\nbuparlisib arm versus 1.6\\xa0months in the placebo arm. A similar result was obtained \\nfor PIK3CA status in tumor tissue.\\n Fulvestrant\\nAnother strategy used to overcome resistance to single-agent endocrine therapy is \\nto target the ER.\\xa0 Fulvestrant binds to the ER, causing its downregulation; thus, \\nestradiol may compete for receptor site occupancy. Preclinical studies [28] have \\nsuggested that the antitumor effects of fulvestrant can be increased in a low-e strogen \\nenvironment, and studies in breast cancer xenografts have found the combination of \\nan AI with fulvestrant to have synergistic antitumor effects. Combination endocrine \\ntherapy using AIs and fulvestrant in the metastatic setting has been studied in large \\nrandomized clinical trials with discordant results [29, 30]. The Southwest Oncology \\nGroup (SWOG) 0226 study demonstrated a median PFS of 13.5\\xa0months (95% CI, \\n12.1–15.1\\xa0 months) for the anastrozole arm compared with 15\\xa0 months (95% CI, \\n13.2–18.4 months) for the combination arm (HR, 0.8; p\\xa0=\\xa00.007), with overall sur-\\nvival (OS) favoring the combination arm as well (HR, 0.81; p\\xa0=\\xa00.049). However, \\nsubgroup analysis demonstrated that the benefit was restricted to patients who had \\nnot received prior tamoxifen (HR, 0.74; p\\xa0 =\\xa0 0.006) rather than those previously \\ntreated with tamoxifen (HR, 0.89; p\\xa0=\\xa00.39) [30]. The Fulvestrant and Anastrozole \\nCombination Therapy (FACT) study [29] and the Study of Faslodex with or without \\nconcomitant Arimidex vs Exemestane following progression on NSAIs (SoFEA) \\n[28], on the other hand, showed no difference in median PFS.\\xa0These results there-\\nfore have had limited applicability in clinical practice. However, neither the SWOG \\n22 Systemic Treatment of\\xa0HER2-Negative Metastatic Breast Cancer 491\\n0226 study nor the FACT study investigated fulvestrant alone as a control arm, \\nalthough data from SoFEA suggest that fulvestrant and exemestane are equivalent \\nin patients whose disease progressed during treatment with a NSAI (HR, 0.95; \\np\\xa0=\\xa00.56). Notably, these studies used the 250-mg dose of fulvestrant, which was \\nsubsequently shown to be inferior to the 500-mg dose in the Comparison of Faslodex \\nin Recurrent or Metastatic Breast Cancer (CONFIRM) study. The 500-mg dose is \\nnow the standard of care dose [9]. In addition, in the front-line setting, the Fulvestrant \\nFIRST-line Study comparing endocrine Treatments (FIRST) suggested that 500\\xa0mg \\nof fulvestrant compared with anastrozole may improve median time to progression \\n(HR, 0.63; p\\xa0=\\xa00.049), and an update at the 2014 SABCS suggested a similar benefit \\nin median OS (HR, 0.7; p\\xa0=\\xa00.04). The FALCON trial, a phase III study that ran-\\ndomly assigned women who were endocrine therapy naïve to fulvestrant (500 mg \\nmonthly) versus anastrozole (1 mg daily), showed a comparable clinical benefit rate \\n(CBR) and a longer PFS for fulvestrant, suggesting its potential as an alternative to \\nAIs as a first-line endocrine agent in postmenopausal women [11].\\n Cyclin-Dependent Kinases 4 and\\xa06 Inhibitors\\nA new strategy in treating patients with ER-positive breast cancer is to target cyclin- \\ndependent kinases 4 and 6 (CDK4/6), a key pathway involved in regulating the G1/S \\ntransition of the cell cycle. Preclinical studies combining tamoxifen with the CDK4/6 \\ninhibitor palbociclib demonstrated synergistic antitumor effects, which led to a phase \\n2 study randomizing 165 women with ER-positive MBC to front-line letrozole alone \\nor in combination with palbociclib. This study showed a significant difference in \\nPFS between the letrozole arm (10.2\\xa0months; 95% CI, 5.7–12.6\\xa0months) and the \\ncombination arm (20.2\\xa0months; 95% CI, 13.8–27.5\\xa0months) (HR, 0.488; 95% CI, \\n0.139–0.748; p\\xa0<\\xa00.001) [31]. The confirmatory phase III PALOMA-2 study ran-\\ndomized a total of 666 postmenopausal patients with ER+ MBC and no prior sys-\\ntemic therapy to receive letrozole with palbociclib or letrozole with placebo. Median \\nPFS (the primary endpoint) was 24.8\\xa0months versus 14.5\\xa0months in favor of the \\npalbociclib arm (hazard ratio [HR], 0.58; 95% CI, 0.46–0.72; p\\xa0<\\xa00.000001) [32]. \\nThe response rate was also improved in the palbociclib arm (42.1% vs. 34.7%, \\np\\xa0=\\xa00.031), and the clinical benefit rate was 84.9% versus 70.3% (p\\xa0<\\xa00.0001). Similar \\nevidence of efficacy was observed in the phase III PALOMA-3 trial for the combina-\\ntion of fulvestrant plus palbociclib, in which PFS was 9.2\\xa0months versus 3.8\\xa0months \\nwith fulvestrant plus placebo (HR, 0.42; p\\xa0<\\xa00.000001) in patients with disease pro-\\ngression after at least one line of hormonal therapy and at most one line of chemo-\\ntherapy but naive to CDK4/6 inhibitors [33, 34]. In both phase III trials, the most \\ncommon grade 3 or 4 adverse event in the palbociclib arms was neutropenia (inci-\\ndence 62–65%), but treatment was otherwise well-tolerated. Both palbociclib (or \\nother CDK4/6 inhibitors) with letrozole for first-line treatment and palbociclib (or \\nother CDK4/6 inhibitors) with fulvestrant for second-line treatment of patients with \\nER+/HER2-negative MBC are approved by the U.S.\\xa0Food and Drug Administration \\n(FDA). The current standart practice for these patients will be discussed in Chap. 24.\\n492 S. Bayraktar and A. Aydiner\\n Treatment of\\xa0Endocrine-Refractory or Triple-Negative \\nMetastatic Breast Cancer that Presents with\\xa0Visceral Threat\\nAdmittedly, using receptor status and sensitivity to guide management of therapy in \\nMBC oversimplifies the discrete molecular subtypes identified through advances in \\ngenomic analysis. For example, the biological behavior and drivers of an ER+ lumi-\\nnal breast cancer that becomes hormone-insensitive are presumably distinct from \\nthose of triple-negative basal-like subtypes, as evidenced by different patterns of \\nrelapse and response to treatment [35].\\nA guiding principle of treatment of metastatic disease is to respect the palliative \\ngoal of this therapy given the absence of data demonstrating superior survival ben-\\nefit with combination cytotoxics rather than sequential strategies. Sequential admin-\\nistration of single agents has been considered a viable and acceptable standard of \\ncare, and this is due, in part, to Intergroup trial E1193, in which, despite increased \\nRR and time to treatment failure with combination paclitaxel and doxorubicin in \\nmetastatic disease, sequential doxorubicin followed by paclitaxel and vice versa \\nshowed similar efficacy and no difference in survival benefit [36]. Many patients \\nwill require multiple lines of therapy for advanced disease, and consequently, use of \\ncombination chemotherapy regimens rather than sequential use of single-agent \\ncytotoxics should be limited to specific circumstances in which performance status \\npermits it and rapid response is critical, as with impending organ failure. Cytotoxics \\nthat have FDA-approved indications in MBC and activity as single agents include \\nanthracyclines, taxanes, non-taxane microtubule inhibitors, and antimetabolites \\n(Table\\xa022.2).\\n Anthracycline Single-Agent Cytotoxic Therapy: Doxorubicin, \\nEpirubicin, and\\xa0Pegylated Liposomal Doxorubicin\\nMany patients will have been exposed to anthracyclines in the adjuvant setting; \\nhowever, with the advent of docetaxel/cyclophosphamide as a standard adjuvant \\ndoublet, more patients may present with recurrent disease without having been \\nexposed to these agents. Women with metastatic disease (receptor status not \\nreported) exposed to alkylators in the adjuvant setting or to, at most, one line of \\ntherapy in the advanced setting or to both were randomly assigned to doxorubicin \\n75\\xa0mg/m2 versus docetaxel 100\\xa0mg/m2 every 3\\xa0weeks. Although docetaxel resulted \\nin a higher objective RR in this pretreated population with visceral disease, there \\nwas no statistically significant difference in median TTP or OS.\\xa0Neutropenic fever, \\ninfection, cardiac toxicity, nausea, and vomiting were more likely with anthracy-\\ncline therapy, whereas the primary toxicities caused by docetaxel consisted of diar-\\nrhea, neuropathy, fluid retention, and skin and nail changes [37].

This dose was found to afford the great-\\nest TTP with the least toxicity and is further evidence of the efficacy of single-a gent \\nanthracyclines [38]. Pegylated liposomal doxorubicin (PLD) has also been exam-\\nined in the hope that preferential accumulation in tumor tissue would limit cardio-\\ntoxicity. In a noninferiority trial designed to assess efficacy and cardiac safety, \\nwomen who could have received prior adjuvant anthracycline were randomly \\nassigned to either PLD or doxorubicin. Non-inferiority was achieved; however, not \\nsurprisingly, significantly more doxorubicin-treated patients met the protocol- \\ndefined criteria for cardiotoxicity [39].\\n494 S. Bayraktar and A. Aydiner\\n Taxane Single-Agent Cytotoxic Therapy: Paclitaxel \\nand\\xa0Docetaxel\\nSingle-agent taxanes are an effective option in metastatic patients, particularly in \\nthose who were treated with only anthracycline-based adjuvant therapy. Taxanes \\ninduce mitotic arrest by inhibiting depolymerization of the microtubules. Although \\nthe mechanisms of binding to tubulin and cell cycle arrest through stabilization of \\nmicrotubules of paclitaxel and docetaxel are similar, preclinical studies have shown \\nthat docetaxel has greater affinity, longer retention time, and higher intracellular con-\\ncentration in target cells [40]. The side-effect profiles are also different because fluid \\nretention and fatigue are more characteristic of docetaxel toxicity, whereas hyper \\nsensitivity and neurotoxicity are more common with paclitaxel. This difference is \\nthought to be related to the solvents requiríng for stabilization of these hydrophobic \\ncompounds. Several studies have examined optimal dosing regimens of taxanes. \\nWeekly paclitaxel appears to be as effective as or more effective than every-2 1- day \\ndosing [41, 42]. Docetaxel administered every 3\\xa0weeks has better efficacy compared \\nwith either weekly or every-3-week paclitaxel but at the expense of greater toxicity \\n[40]. Docetaxel on a weekly schedule still results in some fatigue, fluid retention, and \\nexcess lacrimation but less myelosuppression and neuropathy [43]. Nab-paclitaxel \\nappears to be more effective and convenient than paclitaxel and docetaxel and affords \\nthe benefit of taxane therapy without steroid premedication [44].\\n Non-Taxane Microtubule Inhibitor Single-Agent Cytotoxic \\nTherapy: Vinorelbine, Ixabepilone, and\\xa0Eribulin\\nOther microtubule inhibitors efficacious in the treatment of metastatic disease in \\nthose exposed/resistant to anthracyclines and taxanes include vinorelbine, ixa-\\nbepilone, and eribulin. Nearly a quarter of patients who progressed through \\nanthracyclines and taxanes treated with weekly vinorelbine (dose modified to \\n25\\xa0mg/m2 because of hematological toxicity and neurotoxicity) had an objective \\nresponse [45]. Vinorelbine binds to tubulin, inhibiting tubulin polymerization, \\nand this may explain why sensitivity to vinorelbine is retained among patients \\npretreated with taxanes because excess depolymerized tubulin has been noted \\nin\\xa0vitro.\\nIxabepilone is an epothilone B analog that increases polymerization but, unlike \\ntaxanes, has the capacity to bind to multiple isomers of tubulin. Ixabepilone has \\nbeen evaluated in the setting of patients pretreated with anthracyclines, taxanes, and \\ncapecitabine as well as in first-line metastatic treatment of patients treated with \\nadjuvant anthracyclines. In the first-line setting, women with MBC achieved an \\noverall RR of 41.5% and a median survival of 22\\xa0months [46, 47]. Modifications in \\nthe administration schedule of ixabepilone in a group of women who had not had \\nprior taxane exposure did reduce neurotoxicity while maintaining RRs comparable \\n22 Systemic Treatment of\\xa0HER2-Negative Metastatic Breast Cancer 495\\nto those of historical controls of docetaxel or paclitaxel in the first- or second-line \\nmetastatic setting [48]. Women with taxane-resistant MBC or those pretreated with \\ntaxanes and capecitabine had RRs ranging from 11% to 12% and a durable response \\nof nearly 6\\xa0months [49, 50]. In this heavily pretreated population with prior expo-\\nsure to taxane therapy, half experienced reversible sensory neuropathy.\\nEribulin is the latest non-taxane microtubule inhibitor with a mechanism distinct \\nfrom that of taxanes, epothilones, and vinca alkaloids in that it affects centromere \\ndynamics and sequesters tubulin into nonfunctional aggregates. Like vinorelbine, \\neribulin decreases polymerization of microtubules [51]. Phase II studies have shown \\nefficacy in populations pretreated with anthracyclines and taxane as well as \\ncapecitabine. Despite a median of four prior regimens, women still achieved RRs \\nranging from 9% to 14% and a PFS of approximately 2.6\\xa0months [52]. A phase III \\ntrial randomly assigning heavily pretreated patients to eribulin showed an improve-\\nment in OS of 13.1\\xa0months compared with 10.6\\xa0months in women treated according \\nto physician’s choice. Neutropenia (52%), fatigue (54%), and neuropathy (35%) \\nwere common toxicities [53].\\n Antimetabolite Single-Agent Cytotoxic Therapy: Capecitabine \\nand\\xa0Gemcitabine\\nAntimetabolite therapy should be considered in women with prior exposure to \\nanthracycline and taxane therapy. Capecitabine is an orally administered precursor \\nof 5-deoxy-5-fluorouridine monotherapy that is preferentially converted to \\n5- fluorouracil in tumor tissue by exploiting the high intratumoral concentrations of \\nthymidine phosphorylase. A group of women who had received over three prior \\ncytotoxic regimens, including prior anthracycline and taxane therapy, achieved an \\nobjective RR of 26% and a median survival of 12.2\\xa0months with capecitabine mono-\\ntherapy, even though nearly half required dose reduction. Retrospective analysis \\nsuggested that dose reduction for palmar-plantar erythrodysesthesia, diarrhea, and \\nnausea did not affect efficacy [54]. Capecitabine monotherapy was also tested in the \\nfirst-line setting against cyclophosphamide/methotrexate/fluorouracil with compa-\\nrable RRs, although palmar-plantar erythrodysesthesia induced by capecitabine \\nrequired treatment interruptions and dose reductions in a third of patients [54]. \\nCapecitabine at a lower dose of 1000\\xa0mg/m2 daily for 14 days of a 21-day cycle was \\ncompared with previously tested regimens of 1250\\xa0mg/m2 to assess safety in women \\nat least 65\\xa0years of age, half of whom had received prior systemic treatments. The \\nlower dose afforded similar rates of tumor response with better tolerability in the \\nlower-dose group [55].\\nGemcitabine has also been evaluated as a single-agent therapy in multiple trials \\nin both the first-line and refractory/resistant settings at doses ranging from 800 to \\n1200 mg/m2 weekly for 3\\xa0weeks on a 28-day cycle. RRs varied from 14.5% to 37% \\nwith an OS of 21\\xa0months in the first-line setting to RRs of 20–37.1% with an OS of \\n11\\xa0months in a pretreated setting [56, 57].\\n496 S. Bayraktar and A. Aydiner\\n Platinum Agents\\nThe efficacy of platinum agents in TNBC documented in the neoadjuvant setting \\nhas made them attractive agents for consideration in the metastatic setting [58]. A \\nretrospective study [59] has shown that in patients with metastatic TNBC, platinum- \\nbased chemotherapy is associated with improved survival. The Triple-Negative \\nBreast Cancer Trial (TNT), recently presented at the 2014 SABCS, randomized \\n376 unselected patients with metastatic TNBC to carboplatin vs docetaxel. In the \\noverall analysis, median PFS was not statistically significant (P\\xa0 =\\xa0 0.29; 3.1 vs \\n4.5\\xa0 months for the carboplatin and docetaxel arms, respectively). However, for \\npatients with breast cancer susceptibility gene (BRCA) germline mutations, the \\nORR for the carboplatin arm was more than double that of the docetaxel arm (ORR, \\n68.0 vs 33.3%; P\\xa0=\\xa00.03); homologous recombination deficiency (HRD) scores did \\nnot predict a benefit [60]. Moving forward, it will also be important to delineate \\nwhich patients are most likely to derive benefit from platinum-based therapy and \\nwhether BRCA germline mutations or HRD biomarkers can predict who is most \\nlikely to benefit.\\n New Approaches for\\xa0Triple-Negative  \\nBreast Cancer (TNBC): PARP Inhibitors  \\nand\\xa0Beyond\\nSubtypes of TNBC have been described on the basis of histopathological features \\nand gene expression profiling, highlighting the heterogeneity and complexity of \\nthese tumors [61]. Four distinct breast cancer subtypes (luminal A, luminal B, \\nHER2 enriched, and basal-like) of prognostic and predictive significance were first \\ndescribed by Perou et\\xa0al. [2] in 2000 using microarray analysis. Of the four sub-\\ntypes, basal-like tumors are typically of the triple-negative phenotype, and the vast \\nmajority (approximately 80%) of TNBCs are of the basal-like subtype [62]. In \\nanalyzing gene expression profiles of TNBC, Lehmann et\\xa0al. [63] identified six \\ndistinct molecular subtypes (basal-like 1, basal-like 2, immunomodulatory, mes-\\nenchymal, mesenchymal stem-like, and luminal androgen receptor). These molec-\\nular subtypes were refined into four tumor-specific subtypes (basal-like 1, \\nbasal-like 2, mesenchymal, and luminal androgen receptor) following histopathol-\\nogy and laser capture microdissection, which identified infiltrating lymphocytes \\nand tumor- associated stromal cells contributing to the immunomodulatory and \\nmesenchymal stem-like subtypes, respectively [62]. In addition to microarray-\\nbased studies, the genomic landscape of this disease has been extensively interro-\\ngated, resulting in the identification of alterations that add to our burgeoning \\nknowledge of TNBC [64]. The features and alterations unique to these various \\nsubtypes have been incorporated into many ongoing, rationally designed trials to \\nrefine treatment strategies. In this section, we discuss notable novel approaches in \\nthe treatment of TNBC.\\n22 Systemic Treatment of\\xa0HER2-Negative Metastatic Breast Cancer 497\\n PARP Inhibitors\\nThe effectiveness of poly(adenosine diphosphate-ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibi-\\ntors has been of great interest in TNBC, especially in women with BRCA germline \\nmutations. Iniparib, initially thought to be a PARP inhibitor, was studied in a phase 2 \\nstudy in an unselected population of patients with metastatic TNBC and showed \\nimproved PFS (3.6–5.9\\xa0months) and OS (7.7–12.3\\xa0months), prompting a larger phase \\n3 study that did not show improved PFS or OS [65, 66]. Subsequent definitive preclini-\\ncal studies, however, demonstrated that in fact iniparib has weak, if any PARP, inhibi-\\ntory effects [67]. Although these studies nearly put an end to the development of PARP \\ninhibitors in breast cancer, several agents, including olaparib and veliparib among \\nmany others, are now actively being developed [68]. An ongoing phase III trial evaluat-\\ning PARP inhibition in BRCA-mutant MBCs including olaparib, OlympiAD \\n(NCT02000622), has reached its primary endpoint. In this trial, 302 patients with \\ninherited BRCA mutations who had MBC that was either ER-positive or triple-nega-\\ntive were randomly assigned to receive olaparib tablets or standard chemotherapy \\n(capecitabine, vinorelbine, or eribulin) until the cancer worsened or the patient devel-\\noped severe side effects [69]. Tumors shrank in approximately 60% of patients who \\nreceived olaparib, compared with 29% of those who received chemotherapy. At a \\nmedian follow-up of approximately 14\\xa0months, patients who received olaparib had a \\n42% lower chance of cancer progression than those who received chemotherapy. The \\nmedian time to progression was 7\\xa0months with olaparib and 4.2\\xa0months with chemo-\\ntherapy. For women who have a BRCA germline mutation with metastatic ovarian \\ncancer, the first PARP inhibitor, olaparib, has already been approved based on a phase \\n2 study and compelling ORR [70]. Ongoing efforts are focused on molecular diagnos-\\ntics beyond BRCA testing to predict benefit from PARP inhibition as well as the appli-\\ncation of PARP inhibitors in a broader population through combination strategies.\\n Androgen Receptor Blockers\\nThe androgen receptor (AR) has been identified as a possible predictive biomarker \\nfor antiandrogen therapy in breast cancer. The Translational Breast Cancer Research \\nConsortium (TBCRC) 011 study [71], a phase 2 study investigating bicalutamide in \\nAR-positive, ER-negative breast cancer, found a clinical benefit rate (defined as \\ncomplete or partial response or stable disease for >6\\xa0 months) of 19% (95% CI, \\n7–39%), suggesting an antitumor effect even though only 12% of the 424 patients \\ntested had AR positivity. Similarly, in a phase II trial of enzalutamide, a potent AR \\ninhibitor, clinical benefit rate at 16 weeks was 25% (95% CI, 17% to 33%) in the \\nintent-to-treat (ITT) population (all enrolled patients) and 33% (95% CI, 23% to \\n45%) in the evaluable subgroup. Median progression-free survival was 2.9 months \\n(95% CI, 1.9 to 3.7 months) in the ITT population and 3.3 months (95% CI, 1.9 to \\n4.1 months) in the evaluable (whose tumor expressed ≥10% nuclear AR) subgroup. \\nMedian overall survival was 12.7 months (95% CI, 8.5 months to not yet reached) \\nin the ITT population and 17.6 months (95% CI, 11.6 months to not yet reached) in \\n498 S. Bayraktar and A. Aydiner\\nthe evaluable subgroup [72]. In this study, an androgen-driven diagnostic gene sig-\\nnature was associated with greater clinical benefit, and the phase III ENDEAR trial \\nof paclitaxel plus enzalutamide/placebo and enzalutamide monotherapy has been \\ninitiated in diagnostic signature-positive TNBC (NCT02929576) [73].\\n Antibody-Drug Conjugates\\nAntibody-drug conjugates (ADCs) are a novel class of cancer therapeutics that \\ncombine the selectivity of a targeted treatment with the cytotoxicity of chemother-\\napy, resulting in an improved therapeutic index. Sacituzumab govitecan (IMMU- \\n132) is an anti-Trop-2 ADC consisting of humanized IgG antibody against Trop-2 \\nlinked to SN-38, an active metabolite of irinotecan. The Trop-2 protein is an epithe-\\nlial cancer antigen that is highly expressed in a majority of TNBC compared with \\nnormal tissues and is associated with a poor prognosis and aggressive disease [74]. \\nIn the first-in-human phase I trial, sacituzumab govitecan had an acceptable safety \\nprofile and evidence of efficacy, including one confirmed response and two minor \\nresponses in three of four patients with TNBC [75].\\nIn the ongoing multicenter phase II trial, promising PFS of 5.6\\xa0months (95% CI, \\n3.6–7.1\\xa0months), OS of 14.3\\xa0months (95% CI, 10.5–18.8\\xa0months), and a response \\nrate of 29% were observed in a heavily pretreated (median of five prior therapies) \\npopulation of TNBC [76]. Sacituzumab govitecan has been given breakthrough \\ntherapy and fast-track designation from the FDA, and a phase III international mul-\\nticenter randomized trial versus treatment of physician’s choice in refractory \\nmTNBC is planned for initiation in 2017 (NCT02574455).\\nGlembatumumab vedotin (CDX-011) is a fully human IgG2 monoclonal anti-\\nbody with high affinity for the extracellular domain of glycoprotein nonmetastatic \\nB linked to the microtubule inhibitor monomethyl auristatin E (MMAE). \\nGlycoprotein nonmetastatic B is highly expressed in TNBC compared to normal \\ntissue, predicts breast cancer recurrence, and is associated with reduced overall sur-\\nvival [77]. Early activity was observed in mTNBC and high-gpNMB-expressing \\ntumors in the phase II EMERGE study [65]. The METRIC trial, a randomized phase \\nIII study evaluating glembatumumab vedotin versus capecitabine, is ongoing in \\ngpNMB overexpressing TNBC (NCT01997333).\\n Combination Cytotoxic Therapy\\nCombination therapies generally increase RR and TTP but with a concomitant \\nincrease in toxicity. Moreover, a critical shortcoming of studies in this area is the use \\nof study designs in which the combination is compared with one or the other of the \\nagents alone. The lack of comparison between sequential use of both agents and the \\ncombination biases these studies in favor of the combination. Many cytotoxic \\n22 Systemic Treatment of\\xa0HER2-Negative Metastatic Breast Cancer 499\\ncombinations have been assessed in the metastatic setting; however, only a few have \\nshown synergy in phase III studies to prolong OS over single-agent cytotoxics with \\nmanageable toxicities, and these regimens will be reviewed here.\\nThe low myelotoxicity of capecitabine makes it an attractive agent for combina-\\ntion with other cytotoxics, and preclinical work showing tumor overexpression of \\nthymidine phosphorylase by taxanes suggested that this was an opportunity for syn-\\nergy. Patients pretreated with anthracycline (prior paclitaxel was permitted) were \\nrandomly assigned to capecitabine/docetaxel or docetaxel monotherapy, and the \\ncombination resulted in an increased RR, TTP, and OS.\\xa0However, the improvement \\nin efficacy was at the cost of more grade 3 adverse events (71% versus 49%) in the \\ncombination arm. The 1250\\xa0mg/m2 twice-daily dose of capecitabine may have been \\ntoo high to use in combination with docetaxel given evidence that 1000\\xa0mg/m2 twice \\ndaily of capecitabine monotherapy is equivalent to higher doses in women at least \\n65\\xa0years old. Treatment interruption was required in 34% of capecitabine cycles and \\n27% of docetaxel cycles compared with 20% in the single-agent arm [78]. This trial \\ndid not answer the question of whether sequential administration would have had \\nequivalent benefit with less toxicity.\\nAnother study compared the combination of gemcitabine plus paclitaxel to gem-\\ncitabine alone in the first-line treatment of metastatic disease. Median survival was \\n18.6 versus 15.8 months (P\\xa0=\\xa00.0489) with a longer TTP (6.14 versus 3.98\\xa0months; \\nP\\xa0=\\xa00.0002) and a higher RR (41.4% versus 26.2%; P\\xa0=\\xa00.0002). However, the 22% \\nimprovement in OS and 43% improvement in TTP were at the expense of more neu-\\ntropenia, fatigue, and neuropathy. Again, the trial did not answer the question of \\nwhether sequential single-agent therapy would have yielded equivalent results [79]. \\nThe study design also precluded comparison with a weekly paclitaxel schedule, which \\nappears preferential to a three-weekly schedule in the advanced setting [79, 80].\\nGiven the proposed deficiency of DNA-repair mechanisms in triple-negative and \\nbasal-like tumors, platinum-based chemotherapy combinations have been presented \\nas a strategy to treat these subtypes of MBC.\\xa0Although phase II studies of carbopla-\\ntin- or cisplatin-based combination regimens have demonstrated overall RRs rang-\\ning from 29% to 41% in triple-negative MBC, these responses are often at the \\nexpense of significant hematological and non-hematological side effects, including \\nperipheral neuropathy, nephrotoxicity, and nausea [81, 82]. In light of the high rates \\nof grade 3/4 toxicities for a palliative regimen and absence of prospective phase III \\ndata showing improvement in PFS and OS, the use of combination platinum-based \\ntherapy in triple-negative MBC warrants further study [83].\\nIn summary, women whose MBC requires cytotoxic therapy have multiple alter-\\nnatives. Monotherapy is preferable to minimize side effects given the paucity of \\ndata comparing combination regimens to sequential use of single agents. Presuming \\nadequate performance status, women with prior exposure to anthracyclines should \\nonly receive paclitaxel, albumin-bound paclitaxel, or docetaxel as first-line treat-\\nment for their triple-negative or endocrine-refractory metastatic disease. Women \\nwho have progressed through taxane therapy can be treated with alternative micro-\\ntubule inhibitors such as vinorelbine or eribulin if they do not have prohibitive resid-\\nual neuropathy. A reasonable alternative is to treat these women with either \\n500 S. Bayraktar and A. Aydiner\\ncapecitabine or gemcitabine. Combination cytotoxic regimens should be reserved \\nfor women who have good performance status and whose organ function is threat-\\nened by rapidly progressive disease.\\n New Directions in\\xa0Targeting Angiogenesis\\nAlthough numerous studies investigating [84] anti–vascular endothelial growth fac-\\ntor (VEGF) therapy in the neoadjuvant setting have suggested improved pathologic \\ncomplete response rates, especially in TNBC, studies to date have not demonstrated \\na survival benefit in the adjuvant setting or metastatic setting. Multiple studies have \\nnow been conducted in unselected patients with MBC.\\xa0The Eastern Cooperative \\nOncology Group (ECOG) 2100 study [85] found that adding bevacizumab to pacli-\\ntaxel in unselected patients with MBC improved PFS (11.8 vs 5.9\\xa0 months; HR, \\n0.60; p\\xa0<\\xa00.001) but not OS (26.7 vs 25.2 months; HR, 0.88; p\\xa0=\\xa00.16). The Regimens \\nin Bevacizumab for Breast Oncology-1 (RIBBON-1) trial [86, 87] showed that add-\\ning bevacizumab to chemotherapy in HER2-negative MBC also improved PFS but \\nnot OS in the first-line setting; the RIBBON-2 study had similar results in the \\nsecond- line setting. Subgroup analysis, however, suggested that in patients with \\nTNBC, there may be a trend toward OS benefit (HR, 0.624; p\\xa0=\\xa00.05) [88].\\nThe phase 3 IMELDA study randomized patients with HER2-negative MBC to \\nbevacizumab with or without capecitabine after induction with docetaxel and beva-\\ncizumab and found that the addition of capecitabine improved PFS (11.9 vs \\n4.3\\xa0months; p\\xa0<\\xa00.001) and OS (39.0 vs 23.7\\xa0months; P\\xa0=\\xa00.003) despite premature \\ntermination of the study [89]. An update at the 2014 SABCS meeting revealed no \\ndifferences among different subgroups in terms of OS and no significant changes in \\nquality of life measures. These results are difficult to apply in clinical practice \\nbecause there was no control arm investigating capecitabine without bevacizumab. \\nThe TANIA phase 3 study, an investigation of bevacizumab continuation through \\nsecond-line therapy in patients with HER2-negative MBC, reported that PFS was \\nimproved in those continuing bevacizumab (6.3 vs 4.2\\xa0months; p\\xa0=\\xa00.007); however, \\nOS has not been reported to date [90]. A subgroup analysis of the TANIA study \\npresented at the 2014 SABCS meeting suggested a slight benefit in the TNBC popu-\\nlations (median PFS, 4.9 vs 2.1\\xa0months) and that plasma-based VEGF biomarkers \\ndid not predict efficacy [91, 92]. The fact there are no data suggesting an improve-\\nment in OS in patients receiving bevacizumab compared to those who do not and the \\nfailure to identify patients who are more likely to benefit from anti-VEGF therapy \\nhave hindered the development of these drugs for MBC.\\nA key growth factor in angiogenesis is the fibroblast growth factor receptor gene \\n(FGFR), and this may be an important mechanism of resistance to anti-VEGF ther-\\napy. Many genetic aberrations in FGFR have been identified in breast cancer. \\nApproximately 10% of breast cancers will have FGFR aberrations, which are asso-\\nciated with inferior prognosis, especially in luminal-type breast cancers [93]. \\nSeveral targeted drugs are currently under development to target tumors that have \\nFGFR amplification [94].\\n22 Systemic Treatment of\\xa0HER2-Negative Metastatic Breast Cancer 501\\n Promises of\\xa0Immune Therapies\\nThe immune system can identify tumor antigens through immune surveillance, a \\nprocess in which antigen-presenting cells present non–self-antigens to T cells, \\nallowing them to recognize and destroy cells expressing such antigens. A hallmark \\nof oncogenesis is that tumor cells can develop mechanisms to evade such immune \\nrecognition [95]. The success of immune checkpoint blockade in certain cancers has \\nserved as proof-of-concept that immune therapy is a viable therapeutic strategy. \\nCytotoxic T-lymphocyte antigen (CTLA) inhibitors have shown significant and sus-\\ntained antitumor activity in melanoma [96]. Blockade of programmed cell death 1 \\n(PD-1) and PD-L1 has also been found to have antitumor activity in certain cancers, \\nwith 6–17% overall response rates [97]. The effects of single-agent checkpoint \\nblockade are modest, with only a small fraction of patients having clinically signifi-\\ncant responses; however, combination checkpoint blockade with CTLA and PD-1 \\ninhibitors has recently demonstrated synergistic activity, with an ORR of 40% and \\n31% of patients achieving greater than 80% reduction in their tumors by 12\\xa0weeks \\n[98]. These results suggest that combination immune therapy may improve antitu-\\nmor responses.\\nApproximately 20% of TNBCs express PD-L1, and the expression of PD-L1 is \\nassociated with poor prognosis in patients with breast cancer, particularly those \\nwith luminal B and basal-like subtypes, thus making the aggressive phenotype \\nER-positive and TNBC attractive subtypes in which to investigate PD-L1 block-\\nade [99]. An early-phase study [100] presented at the 2014 SABCS meeting dem-\\nonstrated clinical activity of the anti-PD-L1 monoclonal antibody pembrolizumab \\nin patients with heavily treated TNBC.\\xa0In this phase IB study of monotherapy with \\npembrolizumab, the ORR was 18.5% in evaluable patients with TNBC displaying \\nPD-L1 expression (positive staining in stroma or on at least 1% of tumor cells by \\nimmunohistochemistry). The median duration of response was not reached, and \\nthree responders remained on the study for at least 1\\xa0year. These promising results \\nled to the initiation of KEYNOTE-086 (NCT02447003), a larger single-arm phase \\nII study to evaluate the role of pembrolizumab in advanced TNBC and identify \\nbiomarkers of efficacy. The preliminary results of this study were reported at the \\n2017 ASCO Annual Meeting. Of 170 patients enrolled, 44% had ≥3 prior lines of \\ntherapy, 74% had visceral metastases, and 62% had PD-L1+ tumors. ORR was 5% \\nregardless of PD-L1 expression: 0.6% CR, 4% PR, 21% SD.\\xa0The disease control \\nrate was 8% (95% CI: 4–13). Median PFS and OS were 2.0\\xa0 months (95% CI: \\n1.9–2.0) and 8.9\\xa0 months (95% CI: 7.2–11.2), with 6\\xa0 months rates of 12% and \\n69%, respectively. ORR was numerically lower in patients with poor prognostic \\nfactors (e.g., high LDH and liver/visceral metastases) [101]. In addition, \\nKEYNOTE-119 (NCT02555657), a randomized phase III study of pembroli-\\nzumab versus physician’s choice single-agent chemotherapy in pretreated \\nadvanced TNBC, is estimated to complete recruitment in late 2017. Finally, \\natezolizumab has also shown efficacy as a single agent in PD-L1–positive tumors \\nin a phase IA trial in which a cohort of 12 patients with mTNBC were treated, with \\nan ORR of 33% [102].\\n502 S. Bayraktar and A. Aydiner\\n Conclusions\\nAn understanding of the biology of breast cancer has led to important advances in \\nthe development of targeted therapies; however, MBC remains an incurable disease \\nfor most patients. As we learn to use genomic medicine and harness the immune \\nsystem to guide drug development, it is important to start combining drugs using \\nbiologically informed translational science to optimize patient outcomes.\\nReferences\\n 1.

HER2 has several features of an ideal target for breast cancer treatment, \\nand HER2 overexpression is an adverse prognostic factor in women with breast can-\\ncer [2]. The level of HER2\\xa0in human cancer cells with membrane overexpression is \\nmuch higher than that in normal adult tissues, and HER2 overexpression is found in \\nboth the primary tumor and in metastatic sites, indicating that anti-HER2 therapy may \\nbe effective at all disease sites. Trastuzumab was the first of such agents registered for \\nuse in patients with HER2-overexpressing breast cancer. A key first step in appropri-\\nately deciding on the use of HER2-targeted therapy is the accurate determination of \\nHER2 overexpression by either immunohistochemistry (IHC) or fluorescence in situ \\nhybridization (FISH). The current American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO)/\\nCollege of American Pathologists (CAP) guidelines, updated in 2018, define HER2 \\npositivity as 3+ on IHC (circumferential membrane staining in >10% of invasive \\ntumor cells that is complete and intense) or amplified on FISH (single-probe average \\nHER2 copy number ≥6.0 signals/cell, or dual-probe HER2/CEP17 ratio ≥2.0 with an \\naverage HER2 copy number ≥4.0 signals per cell) [1]. The 2018 update on recom-\\nmendations for HER2 testing with ISH method cancelled an equivocal result. Instead, \\nforced pathologists to make a judgement as positive or negative using combination of \\nrepeated IHC and dual-probe ISH method. According to final update, if the HER2/\\nCEP 17 ratio ≥2.0 and average HER2 copy number is <4.0 the result should be \\nA.

If the average HER2 copy number is ≥6.0 \\nand the ratio is <2.0 the result should be positive after completion of a work-up.\\nClinicians should recommend HER2-targeted combinations for first-line treat-\\nment. When the best treatment response has been obtained (usually after \\n6–12\\xa0months of combined therapy), cytotoxic chemotherapy is stopped, and anti-\\nHER2 therapy is continued, although the optimal duration of treatment is unknown. \\nFollowing discontinuation of chemotherapy, endocrine therapy must be added to \\nBox 23.1 Summary of the Optimal HER2-Targeted Therapy for \\nAdvanced Human Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor 2 (HER2)–\\nPositive Breast Cancer\\n• Clinicians should recommend HER2-targeted therapy–based combina-\\ntions for first-line treatment. If HER2-positive advanced breast cancer pro-\\ngresses during or after first-line HER2-targeted therapy, clinicians should \\nrecommend second-line HER2-targeted therapy–based treatment.\\n• If HER2-positive advanced breast cancer progresses during or after second- \\nline or greater HER2-targeted treatment, clinicians should recommend \\nthird-line or greater HER2-targeted therapy–based treatment.\\n• If available, the clinicians should recommend the combination of trastu-\\nzumab, pertuzumab, and a taxane for first-line and trastuzumab emtansine \\n(T-DM1) as second-line treatment. If HER2-positive advanced breast can-\\ncer progresses during or after second-line or greater HER2-targeted treat-\\nment but the patient has not received pertuzumab, clinicians may offer \\npertuzumab.\\n• If the patient has already received trastuzumab, pertuzumab, and T-DM1, \\nclinicians should recommend third-line or greater HER2-targeted therapy–\\nbased treatment (lapatinib plus chemotherapy, trastuzumab plus lapatinib, \\ntrastuzumab plus chemotherapy, trastuzumab or lapatinib plus hormonal \\ntherapy in patients with hormone receptor–positive disease).\\n• If a patient is receiving HER2-targeted therapy and chemotherapy combi-\\nnations, chemotherapy should continue to the time of maximal response, \\ndepending on toxicity and in the absence of progression. When chemo-\\ntherapy ends, clinicians should continue the HER2-targeted therapy, and \\nno further change in the regimen is needed until time of progression or \\nunacceptable toxicities.\\n• If a patient finished trastuzumab-based adjuvant treatment >12\\xa0 months \\nbefore recurrence, clinicians should follow the first-line HER2-targeted \\ntherapy–based treatment recommendations.\\n• If a patient’s cancer is hormone receptor positive and HER2 positive, clini-\\ncians may recommend either HER2-targeted therapy plus chemotherapy or \\n23 Systemic Treatment of\\xa0HER2-Overexpressing Metastatic Breast Cancer 511\\nin select cases endocrine therapy plus trastuzumab/pertuzumab or lapa-\\ntinib/trastuzumab. Clinicians may add endocrine therapy to the HER2- \\ntargeted therapy when chemotherapy ends and/or when the cancer \\nprogresses.\\n• Management of hormone receptor-positive and HER2-positive metastatic \\ndisease without chemotherapy could conceivably include combinations of \\navailable endocrine therapies, with one or more of the currently approved \\nHER2-targeted agents including trastuzumab, pertuzumab, or lapatinib.\\nthe HER2- directed therapy of patients whose tumors are also hormone receptor \\npositive. Further treatment of patients with MBC who progress on HER2-directed \\ntherapy must be based on individual considerations (Box 23.1).\\n First-Line Treatment\\nThe trial by Slamon et\\xa0al. and other randomized controlled trials of trastuzumab \\nreported a benefit for HER2-targeted therapy combinations [2]. Other agents that \\nimprove survival include lapatinib and the combination of trastuzumab plus \\npertuzumab.\\nThere are a number of effective options for single-agent chemotherapy and anti- \\nHER2 agents. Taxanes [2], vinorelbine [3], and capecitabine [4, 5] are generally \\npreferred regimens with anti-HER2 partners. Double-agent chemotherapy with \\nHER2-targeted agents is generally avoided because PFS is improved at the cost of \\nsignificantly increased toxicity [6].\\nMany clinically important randomized trials of first-line treatments for HER2 \\nMBC, including trastuzumab, lapatinib, pertuzumab, trastuzumab emtansine (T-DM1) \\nand mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) inhibitor (everolimus), have affected \\nmedical practice (Table\\xa023.1).\\n Trastuzumab\\nSingle-agent trastuzumab treatment may be reasonable when avoiding the cytotoxic \\nside effects of chemotherapy is desirable but may result in poorer outcomes com-\\npared with trastuzumab administered in combination with chemotherapy [7]. If a \\npatient progresses on single-agent trastuzumab therapy, adding single-agent chemo-\\ntherapy to trastuzumab is an option.\\n512 A.

The \\ncombination of an anthracycline and trastuzumab is not recommended because of \\nthe risk of significant cardiotoxicity [2].\\nThe cardiotoxicity of trastuzumab is reversible in the majority of patients. \\nAdditional treatment with trastuzumab can be considered after recovery of cardiac \\nfunction among patients who experience a cardiac event (Tables 23.2 and 23.3).\\nTrastuzumab is generally not given in combination with multi-agent chemother-\\napy because of the excess risk of toxicity [8, 9]. No trials have demonstrated that \\nthis approach improves OS.\\n Lapatinib\\nAs a second-line combination therapy, lapatinib and capecitabine improve TTP \\ncompared with capecitabine monotherapy for the treatment of HER2-positive MBC \\nrefractory to anthracycline-, taxane-, and trastuzumab-containing regimens [10]. \\nThe use of lapatinib in the first-line setting has been explored in two phase III trials, \\none of which compared lapatinib against placebo [11, 12]. The evidence suggests \\nthat trastuzumab-based regimens should still be considered the standard of care in \\nthis setting (Table\\xa023.1).\\n514 A.

Compared with \\nthe addition of placebo, the addition of pertuzumab to trastuzumab and docetaxel \\nsignificantly improved the median OS of patients with HER2-positive MBC.\\xa0The \\nmedian overall survival was 56.5\\xa0months in the group receiving the pertuzumab \\ncombination, compared to 40.8\\xa0months (95% CI, 35.8–48.3) in those receiving the \\nplacebo combination (hazard ratio favoring the pertuzumab group, 0.68; P\\xa0<\\xa00.001). \\nMedian PFS, as assessed by the investigators, improved by 6.3 months in the pertu-\\nzumab group (hazard ratio, 0.68; 95% CI, 0.58–0.80). Pertuzumab extended the \\nmedian duration of response by 7.7\\xa0months, as independently assessed. Dual HER2 \\nblockade did not increase the risk of cardiac toxicity. Febrile neutropenia was more \\ncommon with pertuzumab (13.8% vs.7.6%), driven mostly by a high incidence in \\nAsian patients (26% vs. 10%), for reasons not currently clearly understood. The rate \\nof grade 3 and 4 diarrhea (7.9% vs. 5.0%) was increased in the pertuzumab arm.\\nIn conclusion, compared with the addition of placebo, the addition of pertu-\\nzumab to trastuzumab and docetaxel significantly improved median OS of patients \\nwith HER2-positive MBC (Table\\xa023.1, Fig.\\xa023.1).\\nMETASTATIC HER-2 POSITIVE\\nBREAST CANCER a-d \\n23 Systemic Treatment of\\xa0HER2-Overexpressing Metastatic Breast Cancer 515\\n T-DM1 (Trastuzumab-Emtansine)\\nThe MARIANNE (NCT01120184) trial recruited more than 1000 patients with \\nHER2-positive MBC who had not received any chemotherapy in the metastatic set-\\nting [14]. According to the primary results from the phase III MARIANNE study, \\npatients with HER2-positive, advanced breast cancer and no prior therapy for \\nadvanced disease were randomly assigned to control (trastuzumab plus taxane), \\nT-DM1 plus placebo, hereafter T-DM1, or T-DM1 plus pertuzumab at standard \\ndoses. Neither experimental arm showed PFS superiority to trastuzumab plus tax-\\nane. The response rate was 67.9% in patients who were treated with trastuzumab \\nplus taxane, 59.7% with T-DM1, and 64.2% with T-DM1 plus pertuzumab; the \\nmedian response duration was 12.5\\xa0months, 20.7\\xa0months, and 21.2\\xa0months, respec-\\ntively. The incidence of grade ≥3 adverse events was numerically higher in the \\ncontrol arm (54.1%) versus the T-DM1 arm (45.4%) and T-DM1 plus pertuzumab \\narm (46.2%). In conclusion, T-DM1 showed noninferior but not superior efficacy \\nand better tolerability compared to taxane plus trastuzumab for first-line treatment \\nof HER2-positive, advanced breast cancer [14].\\nThese results suggest that T-DM1 may be an alternative to trastuzumab plus tax-\\nane in previously untreated HER2-positive MBC.\\n Everolimus (M-TOR Inhibitor)\\nThe BOLERO-1 trial evaluated the combination of everolimus with trastuzumab plus \\npaclitaxel as a first-line treatment for women with HER2-positive, locally advanced \\nbreast cancer or MBC [15]. In this phase 3 trial, patients who had not received previ-\\nous trastuzumab or chemotherapy for advanced breast cancer within 12\\xa0months of \\nrandomization and without previous systemic treatment for advanced disease except \\nendocrine therapy were enrolled. Patients were randomly assigned to receive either \\n10\\xa0mg of everolimus once daily orally or placebo plus weekly trastuzumab intrave-\\nnously at 4\\xa0mg/kg loading dose on day 1 with subsequent weekly doses of 2\\xa0mg/kg of \\neach 4-week cycle plus paclitaxel intravenously at a dose of 80\\xa0mg/m2 on days 1, 8, \\nand 15 of each 4-week cycle. First-line therapy with everolimus plus trastuzumab plus \\npaclitaxel did not show a PFS benefit in patients with HER2-positive advanced breast \\ncancer; the hormone receptor-negative subpopulation derived a clinically robust ben-\\nefit to a median PFS of 7.2\\xa0months, suggesting that everolimus may have a role in this \\npatient subpopulation. The most frequently reported grade 3 or 4 adverse events in the \\neverolimus group versus the placebo group were neutropenia (25% vs 15%), stomati-\\ntis (13% vs 1%), anemia (10% vs 3%) and diarrhea (9% vs 4%). The authors con-\\ncluded that proactive monitoring and early management of adverse events in patients \\ngiven everolimus and chemotherapy are crucial [15] (Table\\xa023.1).\\nTo identify biomarkers to predict the clinical efficacy of everolimus treatment, \\nBOLERO-1 and BOLERO-3 data were retrospectively analyzed. In both studies, \\ndifferential progression-free survival (PFS) benefits of everolimus were consistently \\nobserved in patient subgroups defined by their PI3K pathway status. When analyzing \\n516 A. Aydiner\\nthe combined data sets from both studies, everolimus was associated with a decreased \\nhazard of progression in patients with PIK3CA mutations (HR 0.67), PTEN loss \\n(HR 0.54), or hyperactive PI3K pathway (HR 0.67).This analysis, although explor-\\natory, suggests that patients with human epidermal growth factor receptor 2-positive \\nadvanced breast cancer and tumors with PIK3CA mutations, PTEN loss, or a hyper-\\nactive PI3K pathway could derive PFS benefit from everolimus [16].\\n Anti-HER2 Treatment Plus Endocrine Treatment\\nThe data justify addition of endocrine treatment whenever possible for ER-positive \\nbreast cancer, leading to the current NCCN, ASCO and ESMO recommendations to \\nadd endocrine agents to treatment for most triple-positive breast cancer patients in \\nthe metastatic setting. Addition of hormonal agents to HER2-targeted treatment is \\nrecommended after the completion of cytotoxic chemotherapy. Importantly, the \\nguidelines emphasize that addition of endocrine therapy is not based on direct evi-\\ndence. In addition, they provide no reason why endocrine therapy should be delayed \\nuntil completion of cytotoxic treatment.\\nAnti-HER2 treatment is less effective in Luminal B, hormone receptor-positive \\nbreast cancer. Loibl et\\xa0al. combined individual patient data from five clinical trials \\nevaluating PIK3CA mutations. Patients received either trastuzumab (T), lapatinib \\n(L) or combination T/L in addition to taxane-based chemotherapy. Within the \\nhormone-r eceptor positive (HR+) subgroup, the PIK3CA mutant group had a lower \\npCR rate. HR+/PIK3CA mutant patients appeared to have significantly worse DFS \\n(HR 1.56 P\\xa0=\\xa00.050) [17].\\nFor select patients with HER2-positive and hormone receptor–positive (ER- \\n positive/PgR- positive or negative) breast cancer, endocrine treatment with either \\ntrastuzumab/pertuzumab or lapatinib/trastuzumab may be an acceptable first-line \\ntreatment [18, 19]. We do not typically recommend endocrine therapy alone for \\nhormone receptor-positive, HER2-positive disease. Management could conceivably \\ninclude combinations of available endocrine therapies such as aromatase inhibitors \\n(AIs), selective estrogen receptor down-regulators or tamoxifen, with one or more \\nof the currently approved HER2-targeted agents including trastuzumab, pertu-\\nzumab, or lapatinib. Several trials have examined the addition of HER2-targeted \\nagents to AIs in postmenopausal women [18, 20, 21]. In ALTERNATIVE and \\nPERTAIN trials, dual HER2 blockade + AI showed superior PFS benefit versus \\ntrastuzumab + AI in patients with HER2-positive/HR-positive metastatic breast \\ncancer. These combinations offer an effective and safe chemotherapy-sparing alter-\\nnative treatment regimen for this patient population. Patients with low-volume dis-\\nease, a long disease-free interval, indolent disease or significant comorbidities \\nwould be the most appropriate candidates for endocrine therapy with anti-HER2 \\ntherapy (Fig.\\xa023.1). A number of studies combining HER2-targeting with fulves-\\ntrant, AIs, or CDK4/6 inhibitors are ongoing.\\n23 Systemic Treatment of\\xa0HER2-Overexpressing Metastatic Breast Cancer 517\\nTable 23.4 Second-line randomized phase III studies in HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer patients\\nORR (CR/PR) PFS OS\\nHazard ratio Hazard ratio (95% \\nTrial Study arms % P Months (95% CI), p Months CI), p\\nGBG26/BIG03-05 (von Capecitabine\\xa0+\\xa0trastuzumab 48.1 OR\\xa0=\\xa02.5 8.2 HR\\xa0=\\xa00.69 25.5 HR\\xa0=\\xa00.76\\nMinckwitz [5]) Capecitabine 27 P\\xa0=\\xa00.0115 5.6 P\\xa0=\\xa00.0338 20.4 P\\xa0=\\xa00.257\\nEGF100151 (Cameron Lapatinib\\xa0+\\xa0capecitabine NR NR 31.3\\xa0(weeks) HR 0.5 71.4\\xa0(weeks) HR\\xa0=\\xa00.79\\n[56])a Capecitabine NR 18.6 (weeks) P\\xa0<\\xa00.001 56.6\\xa0(weeks) P\\xa0=\\xa00.077\\nEMILIA (Diéras [23]) T-DM1 43.6 <0.001 9.6 HR 0.65 29.9 HR 0.75\\nLapatinib\\xa0+\\xa0capecitabine 30.8 6.4 P\\xa0<\\xa00.001 25.9 p\\xa0<\\xa00.001\\nBOLERO-3 (André [57]) Everolimus\\xa0+\\xa0trastuzumab\\xa0+\\xa0vinorelbine 41 =0.210 7 HR 0.78 NR\\nTrastuzumab\\xa0+\\xa0vinorelbine 37 5.8 (0.65–0.95) NR\\nP\\xa0<\\xa00.001\\nTH3RESA (Krop [30]) T-DM1 31 =0.0001 6.2 HR 0.53 22·7 HR\\xa0=\\xa00·68; \\nPhysician’s choiceb 9 3.3 P\\xa0<\\xa00.0001 15·8 p\\xa0=\\xa00·0007\\nEGF 104900 (Blackwell Lapatinib\\xa0+\\xa0trastuzumab NR 11.1 HR 0.74 14 HR 0.74 \\n[58]) Lapatinibc NR 8.1 (0.58–0.94) 9.5 (0.57–0.97)\\nLUX Breast I (Harbeck Afatinib\\xa0+\\xa0vinorelbine 46.1 =0.851 5.5 P\\xa0=\\xa00.4272 20.5 p\\xa0=\\xa00.0048\\n[59]) Trastuzumab\\xa0+\\xa0vinorelbine 47 5.6 28.6\\nMBC metastatic breast cancer, ORR objective response rare, CR complete response, PR partial response, PFS progression-free survival, OS overall survival, \\nHR hazard ratio, T-DM1 T-DM1, NE not evaluable, NS non-significant\\naThe lapatinib plus trastuzumab study did include a heavily pretreated population.

EMILIA was a randomized phase 3 study of \\npatients with HER2-positive unresectable, locally advanced or metastatic breast can-\\ncer previously treated with trastuzumab and a taxane. Enrolled patients were ran-\\ndomly assigned (1:1) to trastuzumab emtansine (3.6\\xa0 mg/kg intravenously every \\n3\\xa0weeks) or the control (capecitabine 1000\\xa0mg/m2 self-administered orally twice daily \\non days 1–14 on each 21-day cycle, plus lapatinib 1250\\xa0mg orally once daily on days \\n1–21). A total of 991 eligible patients were enrolled and randomly assigned to either \\ntrastuzumab emtansine (n\\xa0=\\xa0495) or capecitabine and lapatinib (control; n\\xa0=\\xa0496). In \\nthis final descriptive analysis, median overall survival was longer with trastuzumab \\nemtansine than with the control (29.9\\xa0months vs. 25.9\\xa0months; HR 0.75). In the safety \\npopulation, fewer grade 3 or worse adverse events occurred with trastuzumab emtan-\\nsine [48%] than with the capecitabine plus lapatinib control treatment [60%]. In the \\ncontrol group, the most frequently reported grade 3 or worse adverse events were \\ndiarrhea [21%], followed by palmar-plantar erythrodysesthesia syndrome [18%] and \\nvomiting [5%]. The safety profile of trastuzumab emtansine was similar to that \\nreported previously; the most frequently reported grade 3 or worse adverse events in \\nthe trastuzumab emtansine group were thrombocytopenia [14%], increased aspartate \\naminotransferase levels [5%], and anemia [4%]. This descriptive analysis of final \\noverall survival in the EMILIA trial shows that trastuzumab emtansine improved \\n23 Systemic Treatment of\\xa0HER2-Overexpressing Metastatic Breast Cancer 519\\nTable 23.5 Dosage dose modification of T-DM1 based on asymptomatic left ventricular ejection \\nfraction decrease from baseline\\nLeft ventricular ejection \\nCriteria fraction (LVEF) Action Action at LVEF reassessment\\n1 >45% Continue and follow Follow actions based on criteria\\nroutine monitoring \\nguidelines\\n2 40–45% AND\\xa0<\\xa010% Continue and repeat Discontinue permanently if no \\nbelow baseline and LVEF in 3\\xa0weeks recovery.

In a \\nphase II study, 4 of 35 patients with trastuzumab-resistant metastatic breast cancer \\nshowed partial responses [24]. Adverse events included diarrhea and rash. However, \\nthe recently published LUX-Breast 1 [25] trial was a negative trial for afatinib. This \\nwas a phase III study comparing vinorelbine plus trastuzumab or afatinib plus \\nvinorelbine for metastatic patients who progressed to one chemotherapy regimen \\ncontaining trastuzumab. Recruitment was stopped on April 26, 2013, after a benefit- \\nrisk assessment by the independent data monitoring committee was unfavorable for \\nthe afatinib group. Patients on afatinib plus vinorelbine were required to switch to \\ntrastuzumab plus vinorelbine.\\n Neratinib\\nNeratinib is also an oral, irreversible inhibitor of HER1,-2 and -4. On the basis of the \\nExteNET study, neratinib was recently approved by the FDA for extended post- \\ntrastuzumab adjuvant treatment [26]. However, neratinib failed to show superiority over \\ncomparators in metastatic settings. Neratinib was compared with trastuzumab (both in \\ncombination with taxanes) as first-line treatment by the NEfERT trial, which reported \\nidentical PFS in both arms (12.9\\xa0months) and much higher toxicity in the neratinib arm \\n(grade 3 diarrhea developed in up to 30% of patients) [27]. In a second-line trial that \\n520 A. Aydiner\\ncompared neratinib monotherapy with the combination of lapatinib\\xa0+\\xa0capecitabine, the \\nneratinib arm showed shorter PFS and OS than the combination [28]. In addition, a sub-\\nanalysis of NEfERT-T trial showed that neratinib was more effective against brain \\nmetastases (relative risk of central nervous system [CNS] recurrences 0.48, p\\xa0=\\xa00.002). \\nNew trials of neratinib may be expected in patients with brain metastases.\\n MM-111\\nMM-11 is a bi-specific monoclonal antibody that reversibly targets the HER2 and \\nHER3 heterodimer. A phase I–II study is currently evaluating the efficacy of \\nMM-111 as a single agent in HER2 positive advanced breast cancer patients who \\nhave received prior trastuzumab or lapatinib therapy (clinicaltrials.gov, \\nNCT00911898). Another phase I trial is studying MM-111 plus trastuzumab in \\nHER2-positive, heregulin-positive, advanced and refractory breast cancer (clinical-\\ntrials.gov, NCT01097460).\\n MM-302 (HER2-Targeted Antibody-Liposomal Doxorubicin \\nConjugate)\\nMM-302 is a novel, HER2-targeted antibody-liposomal doxorubicin conjugate that \\nspecifically targets HER2-overexpressing cells. HERMIONE is an open-label, mul-\\nticenter, randomized Phase 2 trial of MM-302 plus trastuzumab versus chemother-\\napy of physician’s choice (gemcitabine, capecitabine, or vinorelbine) plus \\ntrastuzumab planned to enroll 250 anthracycline-naïve patients with locally \\nadvanced/metastatic HER2-positive breast cancer. The HERMIONE study will \\nevaluate the efficacy and safety of MM-302 plus trastuzumab in patients with refrac-\\ntory HER2-positive advanced/metastatic breast cancer for whom there are no stan-\\ndard of care therapies with a proven survival advantage [29].\\n Third-Line Therapy and\\xa0Beyond\\nThe lapatinib plus trastuzumab study did include a heavily pretreated population \\nand showed a benefit for continuing trastuzumab in combination with lapatinib \\nafter progression during previous trastuzumab-containing regimens [5]. These data \\nsupport the continuation of HER2-targeted therapy in the third-line setting and \\nbeyond.\\nPatients with progressive disease after two or more HER2-directed regimens \\nfor recurrent or MBC have few effective therapeutic options. TH3RESA is a \\nphase III trial to specifically address the efficacy of anti-HER2 therapy in this \\n23 Systemic Treatment of\\xa0HER2-Overexpressing Metastatic Breast Cancer 521\\nthird-line setting [30]. Results from the final overall survival analysis of the \\nTH3RESA trial have been reported. Eligible patients for the TH3RESA trial were \\nthose with centrally confirmed HER2-positive advanced breast cancer previously \\ntreated with both trastuzumab and lapatinib (advanced setting) and a taxane (any \\nsetting) and with progression on two or more HER2-directed regimens in the \\nadvanced setting (n\\xa0=\\xa0602). Overall survival was significantly longer with trastu-\\nzumab emtansine versus treatment of physician’s choice (median 22.7 months vs. \\n15.8 months; HR\\xa0=\\xa00.68; p\\xa0=\\xa00.0007). In conclusion, in patients who had pro-\\ngressed on two or more HER2-directed regimens, trastuzumab emtansine treat-\\nment resulted in a significant improvement in overall survival versus treatment of \\nphysician’s choice [30].\\nT-DM1 should be considered as a new standard for patients with HER2-positive \\nadvanced breast cancer who have previously received trastuzumab and lapatinib.\\n Trastuzumab Deruxtecan\\nTrastuzumab deruxtecan (ds-8201a), a HER2-targeting antibody-drug conjugate, \\ndemonstrated significant clinical activity in heavily pretreated patients with HER2- \\nexpressing metastatic breast cancers who previously received T-DM1. Whereas \\nT-DM1 is a tubulin-targeting chemotherapy, trastuzumab deruxtecan is a topoisom-\\nerase 1 inhibitor. It is highly potent, with a drug-to-antibody ratio of 7.8, compared \\nwith 3.5 for T-DM1.\\nIn an ongoing 2-part phase I study, the ORR to trastuzumab deruxtecan in 57 evalu-\\nable patients with HER2-positive tumors was 61.4%. In the HER2-positive cohort, the \\nORR was 56.4% (22 of 39) among those with ER-positive disease and 75.0% (12 of \\n16) among those with ER-negative disease. Notably, the ORR was 62.5% among the \\n50 patients in this cohort with prior pertuzumab treatment. The disease control rate \\nwas 94.7% overall in the HER2-positive subset: 92.3% in the ER-positive group, \\n100.0% in the ER-negative group, and 94.0% among those who had received prior \\npertuzumab. Median PFS was not yet reached in the ER-positive group and was \\n10.3\\xa0months in the ER-negative group. Median PFS was 10.3\\xa0months in the HER2-\\npositive cohort who had received prior pertuzumab, as reported by Shanu Modi, MD, \\nat the 2017 San Antonio Breast Cancer Symposium [31]. The main toxicity was grade \\n1/2 gastrointestinal toxicity. Grade 1/2 nausea was reported by 67.9%. Grade 3 and 4 \\nevents were hematological in nature. The rates of grade 3/4 anemia were 8.7% in the \\nHER2-positive group and 0.9% in the HER2-low group. The rates of grade 3 decreases \\nin neutrophil count and white blood cell count were each 10.4%.

For patients with recurrence ≤12\\xa0months after adjuvant treatment:\\nIf the patient finished trastuzumab-based adjuvant treatment ≤12\\xa0 months \\nbefore recurrence, clinicians should follow the second-line HER2-targeted ther-\\napy–based treatment recommendations. For patients who progress 6\\xa0months or \\nlonger after the completion of adjuvant trastuzumab (without pertuzumab), \\ntrastuzumab plus pertuzumab in combination with a taxane can also be sug-\\ngested [32] (Tables 23.6, 23.7, and 23.8).\\n 2. For patients with recurrence >12\\xa0months after adjuvant treatment:\\nIf the patient finished trastuzumab-based adjuvant treatment >12\\xa0months before \\nrecurrence, clinicians should follow the first-line HER2-targeted therapy–\\nbased treatment recommendations [32].\\n524 A. Aydiner\\n Patients Who Require Second- or Later-Line Treatment\\nFor patients with HER2-positive MBC who experience disease progression on a \\nregimen that includes an HER2-directed agent, available options are shown in \\nFig.\\xa023.1. Ongoing studies are evaluating novel therapeutic approaches to overcome \\nprimary and secondary drug resistance in tumors.\\n Duration of\\xa0Chemotherapy or HER2-Targeted Therapy\\nThere are insufficient data to make a single statement on when to stop administering \\nHER2-targeted therapy. In most trials, HER2-targeted therapy was administered \\nuntil disease progression or until toxic adverse events caused the clinician and \\npatient to decide to discontinue therapy. For patients who have an optimal treatment \\nresponse and for whom cytotoxic chemotherapy has been discontinued, the decision \\nto discontinue HER2-directed therapy should be individualized because there are no \\nprospective data to provide guidance. Anti-HER2-directed therapy can be continued \\nfor many years in such patients without disease progression. However, the same can \\nbe said for patients who discontinue treatment. While continuation of HER2- \\ndirected treatment can increase the risk of cumulative toxicity (particularly cardio-\\ntoxicity), increase healthcare costs, and may be inconvenient, these considerations \\nBox 23.2 Summary of Recommendations on Disease Management for \\nPatients with Advanced HER2-Positive Breast Cancer and Brain \\nMetastases\\n• For patients with a favorable prognosis for survival and limited (one to \\nfour) metastases, treatment options include ± surgery and radiation therapy \\n(RT) (whole-brain radiation therapy (WBRT) or stereotactic radiosurgery \\n(SRS) or both).\\n• For other patients with diffuse disease/extensive metastases, options \\ninclude WBRT and, in select cases, only best supportive care and/or pallia-\\ntive care.\\n• For patients with leptomeningeal metastases options include involved field \\nRT to bulky disease or symptomatic sites and intratechal treatment for \\nselect cases with normal cerebrospinal fluid flow (consider placing ven-\\ntricular catheter and subcutaneous reservoir).\\n• For patients whose systemic disease is not progressive at the time of brain \\nmetastasis diagnosis, the same systemic therapy should be continued, and \\nfor patients whose systemic disease is progressive at the time of brain \\nmetastasis diagnosis, clinicians should use the algorithms for treatment of \\nHER2-positive metastatic breast cancer.\\n23 Systemic Treatment of\\xa0HER2-Overexpressing Metastatic Breast Cancer 525\\n• If a patient does not have a known history or symptoms of brain metasta-\\nses, routine surveillance with brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) \\nshould not be performed. Clinicians should have a low threshold for per-\\nforming diagnostic brain MRI testing in the setting of any neurological \\nsymptoms suggestive of brain involvement.\\nmust be balanced by the potential benefit of treatment in delaying (or preventing) \\ndisease progression [32].\\n Targeting HER2 in\\xa0Breast Cancer Brain Metastases\\nPatients with brain metastases should receive appropriate local therapy and systemic \\ntherapy. Local therapies include surgery, whole-brain radiotherapy (WBRT), and \\nstereotactic radiosurgery (SRS). Treatments depend on factors such as patient prog-\\nnosis, presence of symptoms, resectability, number and size of metastases, prior \\ntherapy, and whether metastases are diffuse [33]. Other options include systemic \\ntherapy, best supportive care, enrollment in a clinical trial, and/or palliative care \\n(Box 23.2).\\nThe data strongly support the hypothesis that the best overall treatment also \\nimproves survival in cases of brain metastases [13, 34–39]. Other conventional \\ncytotoxic agents that can cross the blood-brain barrier may act with anti-HER2 ther-\\napy on CNS metastases, and further research is needed.\\nNeratinib is an irreversible pan-ERBB tyrosine kinase inhibitor. In a random-\\nized trial, in first-line HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer, neratinib-paclitaxel \\nwas not superior to trastuzumab-paclitaxel in terms of progression-free survival. \\nWith neratinib-paclitaxel, the incidence of central nervous system recurrences \\nwas lower (relative risk, 0.48; P\\xa0 =\\xa0 0.002) and time to central nervous system \\nmetastases was delayed (HR, 0.45; P\\xa0=\\xa00.004). In spite of its similar overall effi-\\ncacy, neratinib- paclitaxel may delay the onset and reduce the frequency of central \\nnervous system progression, but this finding requires a larger study for confirma-\\ntion [26].\\nBreast cancer is one of the most common tumors involving the leptomeninges. \\nLeptomeningeal carcinomatosis (LCM) of HER2-overexpressing breast carcinoma \\nremains potentially sensitive to HER2-type receptor inhibition if the meningeal \\nblood brain barrier is bypassed. Importantly, the receptor status of a metastasis can \\nchange [40]. Several studies and case reports of intrathecal (IT) trastuzumab to \\ntreat LCM have been published. Extremely low levels of the antibody are detected \\nin the CSF after intravenous trastuzumab; much higher levels could be reached \\nafter intra- ventricular or IT administration, potentially reaching therapeutic \\nconcentrations.\\n526 A. Aydiner\\nSeventeen patients were evaluable for the efficacy and safety of IT trastuzumab \\nfor the treatment of metastatic cancer in HER2-positive breast cancer patients [41]. \\nThe mean age at IT trastuzumab administration was 48\\xa0years, and the mean total \\ndose was 400\\xa0mg. IT trastuzumab alone or as part of combination therapies appeared \\nto be safe; no serious adverse events were reported in 88% of cases. In 69% of \\ncases, there was a significant clinical improvement, whereas 31% exhibited stabili-\\nzation or progression of the disease. A CSF response was observed in 67% of cases. \\nThe median OS was 13.5\\xa0months, whereas the median CNS-PFS was 7.5\\xa0months. \\nIn 24% of cases, IT trastuzumab was administered after CNS progression, with a \\nresponse observed in 75% of cases and a CNS-PFS of 9.4\\xa0months. The cumulative \\ndose of IT trastuzumab given was 1040\\xa0mg (median 1215; range 55–1675). Clinical \\nimprovement (hazard ratio 0.14, 95% CI 0.02–0.91) and cerebrospinal fluid \\nresponse (hazard ratio 0.09, 95% CI 0.01–0.89) were associated with longer CNS-\\nPFS [41].\\nIT trastuzumab thus might be a promising treatment for leptomeningeal involve-\\nment in HER2-positive breast cancer patients, and further studies are warranted to \\noptimize the dose, interval, duration, and combination of drugs for treatment.\\n New Exploratory Strategies\\n Anti-HER-2 Blocking Strategies\\nOngoing trials combining anti-HER-2 agents with drugs blocking other signaling \\npathways hold the promise of further improvement. An auspicious approach appears \\nto be the combination of anti-HER-2 therapy with insulin growth factor receptor \\n(IGFR-1) blocking agents. IGFR-1 inhibition has been shown to restore sensitivity \\nto trastuzumab in animal models [42]. Another potential combination is the dual \\nblockade of HER-2 and SRC, which was recently shown to work as a central node \\ndownstream of multiple trastuzumab-resistance mechanisms [43]. Finally, HER-3 \\nis a strong activator of the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway and has been demonstrated \\nto be up-regulated after HER-2 blockade [44]. Although still in the early phases of \\ndevelopment, Rb disruption strategies and the use of CDK-4/6 inhibitors may be \\nclinically useful [45]. At present, CDK4/6 inhibition is perceived as one of the most \\npromising new directions in the treatment of HER2-positive MBC and may soon be \\nused in clinical practice. A series of trials showed that the addition of CDK4/6- \\ninhibitors to endocrine treatment significantly improves PFS in the metastatic set-\\nting [46]. None of these trials have included HER2-positive patients. The success of \\nthese trials led to regulatory approvals and supported a wave of interest in CDK4/6 \\ninhibitors for the treatment of HER2-positive disease. A number of studies combin-\\ning HER2 targeting with fulvestrant, AIs, or CDK4/6 inhibitors are already ongoing \\n(PATINA, PATRICIA, and monarcHER trials: NCT02947685, NCT02448420, \\nNCT02675231).\\n23 Systemic Treatment of\\xa0HER2-Overexpressing Metastatic Breast Cancer 527\\nFuture studies of HER2-positive patients will be challenging because of the \\nsmall window to improve the outcome beyond what is achievable today.\\n Imvmunotherapy\\nCancer vaccines designed to induce specific anti-HER-2 immunity are being inves-\\ntigated. Different strategies include protein-based vaccines, plasmid DNA-based \\nvaccines, and vaccines that deliver HER-2\\xa0in a viral vector. HER-2 peptide-based \\nvaccines have been tested in patients with metastatic HER-2-positive breast cancer \\n[47]. Immunized patients developed delayed-type hypersensitivity reactions and \\nstrong CD8+ cell responses specific for HER-2 [48]. A dendritic cell-based vaccine \\nwas also tested in a small group of patients with stage IV breast cancer [49]. One \\npatient showed a partial response, and three had stable disease for ≥12\\xa0 months. \\nUsing a different strategy, cell-based GM-CSF secreting vaccines were tested in \\ncombination with trastuzumab [50].\\nThere is a broad array of ongoing breast cancer immunotherapy clinical trials. \\nImmune-therapeutics that augment CD8 T-cell anti-tumor activity—such as anti-\\n PD1, anti-PDL1 and anti-CTLA4 mAbs—given in combination with trastuzumab \\nin patients with HER2-positive breast cancer may improve outcome by involving \\nand enhancing critical host immunity [51–55]. A search for trials of immunothera-\\npies yielded more than 90 clinical trials that are currently enrolling breast cancer \\npatients. The application of immunotherapeutic strategies to the treatment of breast \\ncancer holds promise.\\n Conclusion\\nMany clinically important randomized trials of first- and second-line treatments for \\nHER2 metastatic breast cancer, including trastuzumab, lapatinib, pertuzumab, \\ntrastuzumab emtansine (T-DM1) and mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) \\ninhibitor (everolimus), have affected medical practice. New studies are evaluating \\nnovel therapeutic approaches to overcome primary and secondary drug resistance in \\ntumors. Ongoing trials combining anti-HER-2 agents with drugs blocking other \\nsignaling pathways hold the promise of further improvement.\\nReferences\\n 1.

The 5-year survival rate of females \\nwith metastatic disease is approximately 22% [1]. Early diagnosis via mammo-\\ngraphic screening and implementation of post-surgical [1]. Early diagnosis via \\nmammographic screening and implementation of post-surgical systemic adjuvant \\ntherapy have provided a significant decrease in breast cancer mortalities in devel-\\noped countries. However, breast cancer remains the leading cause of cancer death, \\nwith ~90% of these mortalities due to metastasis of tumor cells to other organs. The \\nmedian survival rate of females with metastatic disease is only 2–3\\xa0 years [2]. \\nApproximately two-thirds of breast cancers are hormone receptor positive (HR+) \\nbased on the immunohistochemical expression of estrogen receptor (ER), proges-\\nterone receptor (PgR), or both receptors [3]. Recent data suggest that if the current \\ntrends continue, the incidence of HR+ breast cancers will increase, whereas the \\nincidence of HR-negative breast cancers will continue to decrease, and the overall \\nincidence of breast cancer will remain similar to its current level [4]. In general, HR \\npositivity is considered both a favorable prognostic factor and a predictor of the \\nefficacy of endocrine therapy (ET) [5]. However, one-third of patients with early-\\nstage HR+ breast cancer who are treated with adjuvant ET with curative intent will \\nexperience disease recurrence with local or distant metastasis. Additionally, approx-\\nimately 5–10% of patients have distant metastasis at initial presentation [6]. The \\nF. Sen \\nDepartment of Medical Oncology, Avrasya Hospital, Istanbul, Turkey \\nA.

Aydiner\\ngoal of treatment in metastatic breast cancer is to improve quality of life and pro-\\nlong survival [7].\\nThe role of hormones in the growth of some tumors was first discovered more \\nthan a century ago when the tumor of a patient with metastatic breast carcinoma \\nregressed following ovariectomy [8]. Later, estradiol was shown to be the most \\npowerful hormone stimulator of breast cancer [9]. Thus, ET including medical or \\nsurgical deprivation and/or antagonism of estradiol is the mainstay of systemic \\ntreatment of patients with HR+ breast cancer [10].\\nCytotoxic drugs or targeted therapies are other systemic treatment options for HR+ \\nadvanced breast cancer. Several systematic reviews or meta-analyses have revealed \\nthat in patients with HR+ advanced breast cancer, ET should be chosen as the first-line \\ntreatment option instead of chemotherapy unless a life-threatening disease that \\nrequires sudden improvement with cytotoxics exists [11]. Overall survival is similar \\nbetween chemotherapy and ET.\\xa0Unfortunately, chemotherapy leads to greater toxicity, \\nparticularly emesis and alopecia. Thus, ET is recommended as the first-line treatment \\noption in the absence of severe symptomatic disease in which an immediate tumor \\nresponse is necessary [12]. However, the definition of the exact number or volume or \\nsymptom level as the cutoff to start chemotherapy rather than endocrine therapy \\nremains a topic of debate. There is no uniform consensus among international breast \\ncancer guidelines on the optimal chemotherapeutic agent as the first line and subse-\\nquent lines, and the number of agents and types of agents are decided based on the \\ncharacteristics of the patient and the tumor, including previous types of therapy, sever-\\nity of adverse reactions, performance status, medical comorbidities, and patient \\nchoices. When an indication of chemotherapy exists in patients with HR+ breast can-\\ncer, a single-agent approach should be preferred over combination chemotherapy [11].\\nDuring the selection of the ET option, the history of previous or ongoing ET, \\nincluding the type of endocrine agent and response to that agent, the setting in \\nwhich ET has been given, and the time of progression are important features. If the \\ntumor progresses one year after adjuvant ET completion, patients should be accepted \\nand treated as endocrine treatment–naive patients. By contrast, if disease metastasis \\nor recurrence occurs under adjuvant ET, under first-line ET in the metastatic setting \\nor within 1\\xa0year after adjuvant ET ended, eligible patients should be evaluated for \\nsubsequent ET.\\xa0The mechanism of action, possible side effects, pharmacological \\ninteractions, cost, availability and route of administration are factors to be consid-\\nered in selecting the type of endocrine agent.\\nAlthough sequencing of ET was the recommended approach until recently, few \\nrandomized trials had directly compared the effects of the order in which different \\nagents are used. Thus, definitive recommendations regarding the optimal ET \\nsequencing in patients with HR+ metastatic breast cancer were difficult to provide \\ndue to lack of sufficient scientific data on ET sequencing [13]. However, based on \\ndata about ET plus other targeted agents from recently published phase II/III ran-\\ndomized trials, some ET options can be used sequentially or preferentially as the \\nfirst line or second line (Figs.\\xa024.1 and 24.2).\\nThe main sources of estrogens that should be suppressed and the choices of ET \\ndiffer between premenopausal and postmenopausal women.

Aromatase, also called estrogen \\nsynthetase or estrogen synthase, is a member of the cytochrome P450 superfamily \\nand is the main enzyme in estrogen biosynthesis in postmenopausal women. In par-\\nticular, aromatase is responsible for the aromatization of androgens into estrogens. \\nAromatase inhibitors (AI) cannot inhibit the ovaries from making estrogen. In pre-\\nmenopausal women, AIs reduce hypothalamic–pituitary estrogen feedback, leading \\nto increased gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) secretion that could, in turn, \\nstimulate the ovarian production of estrogen. Due to the potential for ovary stimula-\\ntion and the probability of resumption of menses, AIs should not be offered alone in \\npremenopausal women.

Women who become amenorrhoeic after chemotherapy \\nshould not be considered postmenopausal. The cessation of menses is not synony-\\nmous with true ovarian failure because estrogen levels can remain in the premeno-\\npausal range despite one year or chemotherapy-induced amenorrhea or longer, and \\nthe AIs might induce the resumption of ovarian function. Patients with a history of \\nbilateral oophorectomy or older than 60\\xa0years are accepted as postmenopausal with-\\nout further requirement for any laboratory testing. For young women (<60\\xa0years) \\nwithout a history of chemotherapy, ovarian function suppression, tamoxifen and \\ntoremifene, amenorrhea for at least for 1\\xa0year and plasma estradiol and FSH levels \\nin the postmenopausal range are required to classify patients as postmenopausal \\n[14]. Monitoring of estradiol, FSH and LH values should be performed before pre-\\nscribing an AI.\\xa0Patients who are receiving a luteinizing hormone-r eleasing hormone \\n(LHRH) agonist or LHRH antagonist should not be evaluated based on plasma FSH \\nor estradiol levels or menstrual status to determine menopausal status (Box 24.1).\\nSelective ER modulators (SERMs), AIs (with ovarian function suppression in \\npremenopausal women), and ER downregulators (SERDs) are the main ET \\noptions in HR+ metastatic breast cancer. Recently, targeted agents in combination \\nwith ET have become an alternative treatment approach in this patient population. \\n24 Endocrine Therapy of\\xa0Metastatic Breast Cancer 537\\nApproximately 20% of HR+ breast cancers are also HER2-positive (HER2+). \\nHER2-directed targeted therapy should be considered in patients with both HR+ \\nand HER2+ breast cancer.\\n Endocrine Therapy in\\xa0HER2-Negative and\\xa0Hormone \\nReceptor-Positive Breast Cancer\\n First-Line Treatment\\nOvarian ablation/suppression: In premenopausal women, pulses of LHRH \\ninduce the pituitary gland to release pulses of gonadotrophins and provide the men-\\nstrual cycles. Treatment with a long-term depot formulation of an LHRH agonist \\ninitially stimulates gonadotrophin release and later leads to a reduction in gonado-\\ntrophin secretion and circulating estrogen to postmenopausal ranges [15]. In a ran-\\ndomized trial, premenopausal women with HR+ MBC were treated with either \\ngoserelin 3.6\\xa0mg repeated monthly or surgical oophorectomy. Goserelin achieved a \\nreduction of serum estradiol levels to postmenopausal levels. Failure-free survival \\nand OS were not different between the treatment arms [16].\\nTamoxifen, a nonsteroidal antiestrogenic compound synthesized in 1966, is an \\nestrogen receptor modifier (SERMs). Tamoxifen and its derivatives have both par-\\ntial agonist activity on ERs located in certain tissues and antagonistic activity on \\nERs located in other tissues. The well-defined agonistic effects that limit their \\nclinical efficacy are endometrial stimulation and induction of tumor growth after \\nprevious response to tamoxifen [17]. After the clinical efficacy of tamoxifen for \\nmetastatic breast cancer was proven in several studies, Food and Drug \\nAdministration approved it for the treatment of MBC in postmenopausal women \\nin 1977. Tamoxifen is currently the most widely prescribed agent for the treatment \\nof both postmenopausal and premenopausal women with breast cancer. Tamoxifen \\nis considered a chemosuppressive agent based on in\\xa0vitro studies. Tamoxifen has \\nbeen shown to prevent the transition of cells from early-G1 phase to mid-G1 \\nphase, induce the accumulation of cells in early-G1 phase of the cell cycle, and \\nreduce the number of cells in S and G2 plus M phases [18]. These shifts have \\ncytostatic effects.\\nTamoxifen has similar effects as ovarian ablation in terms of the overall response \\nrate, progression-free survival and overall survival in premenopausal, HR+ meta-\\nstatic breast cancer as first-line therapy and is unlikely to be substantially inferior. \\nHowever, combined use of tamoxifen with an LHRH agonist was found to be supe-\\nrior to single-agent therapy in several clinical trials [19]. A meta-analysis of ran-\\ndomized trials comparing combination therapy with an LHRH agonist alone in \\npremenopausal women with HR+ metastatic breast cancer with respect to overall \\nsurvival, progression-free survival, and objective response supported the combina-\\ntion therapy [20].\\n538 F. Sen and A. Aydiner\\nTamoxifen has several adverse effects including nausea, menstrual irregularity, \\nvaginal bleeding or discharge; fluid retention, hot flashes, reduction of antithrombin \\nIII activity, and central nervous system symptoms (e.g., depression, irritability, \\nheadache, dizziness, nervousness, inability to concentrate, sleep disturbance, leth-\\nargy, and fatigue) [21, 22]. Bone mineral density is not reduced by tamoxifen [23].\\nToremifene, another SERM, has efficacy against HR+ breast cancer [24]. \\nHowever, toremifene is cross-resistant with tamoxifen and is ineffective as sequen-\\ntial therapy in patients who are refractory to tamoxifen.\\nAromatase inhibitors reduce circulating estrogen levels in both pre- and post-\\nmenopausal women without partial agonist effects. Aromatase, a member of the \\ncytochrome P450 enzyme system, catalyzes the final enzymatic step of estrogen \\nbiosynthesis and converts androstenedione to estrone and testosterone to estradiol, \\nthereby increasing estrogen levels. Aromatase inhibition alone is not recommended \\nin premenopausal women because inhibition of the hypothalamus pituitary aroma-\\ntase increases gonadotropin, which in turn stimulates ovarian follicular growth, \\n producing high levels of circulating estrogen that can induce mammary tumor pro-\\nliferation [25]. The clinical efficacies of combination therapy with AIs (letrozole, \\nanastrozole, exemestane) and ovarian suppression (e.g., goserelin) in premeno-\\npausal patients with HR+ breast cancer were shown to be comparable to those of \\nsingle-agent aromatase inhibitors in postmenopausal women [26, 27].\\nIn postmenopausal women, third-generation AIs have well-established efficacy \\nin HR+ breast cancer as single-agent ET.\\xa0Steroidal (exemestane) and nonsteroidal \\n(anastrozole and letrozole) are the 2 main classes of available third-generation AIs. \\nNSAIs inhibit aromatase reversibly by binding to the heme moiety of the enzyme \\nand preventing androgens from binding to the catalytic site [28]. Steroidal AIs, ana-\\nlogs of androstenedione, which is the substrate of natural aromatase, bind cova-\\nlently to the substrate-binding site of aromatase and irreversibly inactivate the \\nenzyme [28]. Therefore, steroidal nonreversible AIs are also known as aromatase \\ninactivators, whereas NSAIs are reversible inhibitors of aromatase. The major side \\neffects of AIs are osteoporosis and abnormalities of serum lipid levels. However, \\nAIs cause vaginal bleeding and thromboembolic events less frequently than tamoxi-\\nfen. Overall survival was found to be similar to that of tamoxifen in the different \\nindividual trials of the three third-generation AIs, but a meta-analysis showed an OS \\nbenefit of using AIs compared with tamoxifen as first-line therapy for HR+ breast \\ncancer [29]. Currently, both steroidal and NSAIs are one of the standard first-line \\ntreatment options for postmenopausal women with HR+ breast cancer [30, 31].\\nFulvestrant is a novel, steroidal estrogen antagonist with 100 times greater affin-\\nity for the ER than that of tamoxifen. Fulvestrant lacks the uterotrophic activity- \\nblocking estrogen agonist effects found in ER agonists and partial agonists such as \\ntamoxifen and raloxifene. Fulvestrant functionally blocks and decreases the cellular \\nER levels so the ERs become unavailable or unresponsive to estrogen or estrogen \\nagonists in breast cancer. Therefore, fulvestrant is now known as a selective ER \\ndownregulator (SERD) and has neither cross-resistance with tamoxifen nor the \\nER-agonist activity associated with tamoxifen. Since fulvestrant has an attractive \\nmode of action, it has been studied in several phase II and III trials that included \\n24 Endocrine Therapy of\\xa0Metastatic Breast Cancer 539\\npostmenopausal and/or premenopausal women. However, until recently, the dosage, \\nline of therapy and comparison groups were not uniform [32].\\nThe Fulvestrant First-Line Study Comparing Endocrine Treatments (FIRST \\ntrial), a phase II, randomized, open-label, multicenter trial conducted by Robertson \\net\\xa0al. [33], compared fulvestrant 500\\xa0mg (days 0, 14, 28, and every 28\\xa0days thereaf-\\nter) with anastrozole 1\\xa0mg (daily) in postmenopausal women (fulvestrant 500\\xa0mg, \\nn\\xa0=\\xa0102; anastrozole, n\\xa0=\\xa0103) with ER+ advanced breast cancer in the first-line \\nsetting. The primary endpoint (clinical benefit rate [72.5% and 67.0%]) and a fol-\\nlow- up analysis (median time to progression [23.4\\xa0months and 13.1\\xa0months]) have \\nbeen reported for fulvestrant 500\\xa0mg and anastrozole, respectively [33]. Later, OS \\ndata were published, and the hazard ratio (95% CI) for OS with fulvestrant 500\\xa0mg \\nversus anastrozole was 0.70 (0.50–0.98; P\\xa0 =\\xa0 0.04; median OS, 54.1\\xa0 months v \\n48.4\\xa0months) [34]. The treatment effects were generally consistent across the sub-\\ngroups analyzed.\\nProspective confirmation has been demonstrated in the larger phase III FALCON \\n(Fulvestrant and Anastrozole Compared in Hormonal Therapy Naïve Advanced \\nBreast Cancer) trial, which showed that intramuscular fulvestrant 500\\xa0mg/month \\n(plus an additional dose at 2\\xa0weeks) was significantly more effective in terms of PFS \\nthan was anastrozole 1 mg/day (particularly in the non-visceral disease subgroup, \\nPFS: 22.3\\xa0months in the non-visceral subgroup vs 13.8\\xa0months in the visceral group, \\nHR: 0.80) [35]. The objective response rate was similar between the arms, but the \\nmedian OS was not yet calculable. Fulvestrant was well-tolerated in this trial. Thus, \\nmonotherapy with intramuscular fulvestrant is well-tolerated and a more effective \\ntreatment option than standard-of-care anastrozole for ER+ or HR+/HER2- \\nadvanced breast cancer in postmenopausal women not previously treated with endo-\\ncrine therapy [35, 36].\\nThe combined use of multiple endocrine agents has been studied in several stud-\\nies in the first-line setting. The Fulvestrant and Anastrozole Combination Trial \\n(FACT) was an open-label randomized phase III clinical trial designed to compare \\nthe efficacy of anastrozole (1\\xa0mg daily, n\\xa0=\\xa0256) alone with that of combined fulves-\\ntrant (initiated with a loading dose of 500\\xa0mg, 250\\xa0mg on days 14, 28 then 250\\xa0mg \\nevery month) and anastrozole therapy (1\\xa0mg daily and n\\xa0=\\xa0258) in women who had \\nexperienced the first relapse of breast cancer after primary treatment of early disease \\n[37]. Postmenopausal women or premenopausal women receiving an LHRH ago-\\nnist were included. The median time to progression was similar between the experi-\\nmental and standard arms (10.8 and 10.2\\xa0 months, respectively, P\\xa0 =\\xa0 0.91). The \\nmedian OS was also similar between the 2 treatment groups (37.8 and 38.2\\xa0months, \\nrespectively, P\\xa0=\\xa01.00) [37].\\nThe Southwest Oncology Group (SWOG) conducted a similarly designed ran-\\ndomized phase III trial [38]. Treatment-naïve postmenopausal women with advanced \\nbreast cancer were randomized into 2 groups to receive either anastrozole (1\\xa0mg \\norally every day with permission to crossover to fulvestrant (500\\xa0mg on day 1 and \\n250\\xa0mg on days 14 and 28 and monthly) alone as the disease progressed or anastrozole \\nin combination with fulvestrant. The combination therapy resulted in improvement \\nin PFS (15 vs 14\\xa0months; HR 0.80) and OS (48\\xa0months versus 41\\xa0months; HR 0.81). \\n540 F. Sen and A. Aydiner\\nIn subgroup analyses, among women without prior tamoxifen, OS was significantly \\ndifferent between groups, with HR for death with combination therapy of 0.74 \\n(95% CI; p\\xa0=\\xa00.04), whereas OS was similar among women with prior tamoxifen \\nhistory (HR, 0.91; p\\xa0=\\xa00.59). The combination therapy resulted in a benefit in both \\ngroups [38].\\nA meta-analysis of these prospective randomized clinical trials was performed to \\ncompare the effectiveness of fulvestrant plus anastrozole with anastrozole alone as \\nfirst-line treatment in postmenopausal women with HR+, HER2-negative advanced \\nbreast cancer. For endpoints including PFS, OS, and response rates, a non- significant \\ntrend of only marginal improvement was observed for anastrozole plus fulvestrant \\ncompared to anastrozole. The current evidence is not sufficient to recommend the \\ncombination of monthly fulvestrant with anastrozole instead of anastrozole or ful-\\nvestrant alone to all women with postmenopausal HR+ breast cancer as first-line \\ntherapy.\\nA systematic review of 8 randomized trials was performed by Al-Mubarak et\\xa0al. \\nto compare fulvestrant with other endocrine therapies [39]. The meta-regression \\nanalysis demonstrated that fulvestrant, when used in the first-line setting, reduced \\nhazards for time to progression compared with AIs in studies where fewer patients \\nwere administered adjuvant endocrine therapy and at higher doses. Rates of serious \\nadverse events and treatment discontinuation were reported to be similar between \\nthe fulvestrant and other groups, but fulvestrant monotherapy was associated with \\nless frequent arthralgia (OR: 0.73, p\\xa0=\\xa00.02). Combining fulvestrant with AI did not \\nimprove time to progression but increased toxicity. High-dose fulvestrant mono-\\ntherapy, when used as the first line or in patients with limited prior exposure to \\nadjuvant endocrine therapy, may delay progression compared with AI [39].\\nCombined Use of Endocrine Agents with Other Targeted Agents in the First- \\nLine Setting: Despite the efficacy of several endocrine agents, response rates for \\nfirst-line metastatic patients of up to 40% have been described, with all initial \\nresponders eventually developing resistance over time [40]. Due to its clinical \\nsignificance, extensive research has focused on determining the potential mecha-\\nnisms of endocrine resistance. Initially, ER expression loss and polymorphisms of \\nCYP2D6 and CYP19A1 were suggested as the main mechanisms of primary resis-\\ntance to tamoxifen and AIs [41, 42]. However, further studies did not support these \\ndata. Preclinical evidence indicated that targeting the phosphatidylinositol-3-ki-\\nnase (PI3K)/protein kinase B (AKT)/mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) \\npathway, the cell machinery and growth receptor signaling may improve endo-\\ncrine responsiveness. More recently, studies of HR+ metastatic breast cancer \\ndesigned with high-throughput technologies revealed a large number of molecular \\naberrations in potential driver genes, including PI3K3CA mutations, FGFR1 and \\nCCND1 amplifications and ESR1 mutations [43, 44]. These findings led to the \\ndevelopment of several therapies targeting these pathways to circumvent or delay \\nthe occurrence of endocrine resistance. The combination of endocrine agents with \\ntargeted agents is becoming a promising approach in HR+ metastatic breast cancer \\n(Table\\xa024.1).\\n24 Endocrine Therapy of\\xa0Metastatic Breast Cancer 541\\nTable 24.1 Endocrine therapy in hormone receptor positive HER2-negative advanced breast \\ncancer\\nOvarian suppression (GnRH agonist) or ablation to all premenopausal patients\\nEndocrine treatment naïve Previous endocrine treatment\\nNo contraindication Contraindication to Under endocrine treatment Disease recurrence at \\nto CDK inhibitors CDK inhibitors or within 12\\xa0months after least one year after the \\nthe end of adjuvant end of adjuvant \\nendocrine treatment endocrine treatment\\nCDK inhibitora and Fulvestrant CDK inhibitor and Treat as patients who \\naromatase inhibitors fulvestrant are endocrine \\ntreatment naïve\\nCDK inhibitorb and Aromatase CDK inhibitor and \\nFulvestrant inhibitors aromatase inhibitors\\nFulvestrant Tamoxifen Everolimus and \\nexemestane OR tamoxifen \\nOR fulvestrant\\nAbemeciclib and \\ntamoxifen if not used \\npreviously\\nAbemaciclib\\nFulvestrant if not used \\npreviously\\nIf an aromatase inhibitor \\nused previously, switch to \\nother (steroidal to \\nnonsteroidal or vice versa)\\nTamoxifen\\nProgestins\\nEstrogens or androgens\\naPablociclib, ribociclib, abemaciclib\\nbRibociclib\\nCDK4/6 Inhibitors: Analysis of the Cancer Genome Atlas revealed associations \\nof deregulated cyclin D, CDK4/6 and retinoblastoma (Rb) interaction with luminal \\nB cancer [45]. Cyclin D activates CDK4/6 and induces Rb phosphorylation and \\nprogression of the cell cycle into S phase, eventually resulting in endocrine resis-\\ntance [46]. CDK4/6 inhibitors have been demonstrated to improve the efficacy of \\nET.\\xa0Palbociclib, ribociclib and abemaciclib are oral small-molecule inhibitors of \\nCDK4/6 with preclinical and clinical evidence of growth-inhibitory activity in HR+ \\nbreast cancer cells and synergy with anti-estrogens [47–54].\\nPalbociclib: Palbociclib in combination with letrozole received US Food and Drug \\nAdministration (FDA) accelerated approval as a first-line treatment option for HR+ \\nadvanced breast cancer in February 2015 [48]. The approval was based on a random-\\nized, multicenter, open-label phase I/II trial (PALOMA-1) in which 165 patients \\nwere randomized to receive palbociclib (125\\xa0mg orally daily for 21 consecutive days, \\nfollowed by 7\\xa0days off treatment) plus letrozole (2.5\\xa0mg orally daily) or  letrozole \\nalone [49]. A significant improvement in PFS was observed in patients receiving \\n542 F. Sen and A. Aydiner\\npalbociclib plus letrozole (median 20\\xa0 months) compared with patients receiving \\nletrozole alone (median 10\\xa0months) (HR, 0.49; 95% confidence interval, 0.32–0.75). \\nAn improvement in OS was observed in the combination arm versus the letrozole- \\nalone arm (median 37.5 versus 33 months, respectively, p\\xa0=\\xa00.819), although this \\nimprovement did not reach statistical significance. The most common adverse reac-\\ntion in patients receiving palbociclib plus letrozole was neutropenia (grade ¾ toxicity \\n54% in the combination arm vs 15% in the letrozole-alone arm) [48].\\nThe results from the phase III trial, PALOMA-2, which compared letrozole with \\nletrozole plus palbociclib in the first-line setting for HR+ HER2- metastatic breast \\ncancer, supported the findings of previous trials [50, 51]. At a median follow up of \\n23\\xa0months, the median PFS of the combination arm was longer than that of the \\nletrozole-alone arm (HR: 0.58, 24.8\\xa0months vs 14.5\\xa0months, respectively). A con-\\nsistent benefit of palbociclib–letrozole was demonstrated across all subgroups. The \\nsubgroups were visceral disease (HR, 0.63; 95% CI, 0.47–0.85), nonvisceral dis-\\nease (HR, 0.50; 95% CI, 0.36–0.70), presence of previous hormonal therapy (HR, \\n0.53; 95% CI, 0.40–0.70), no history of prior hormonal therapy (HR, 0.63; 95% CI, \\n0.44–0.90), a disease-free interval of 12\\xa0months or less (HR, 0.50; 95% CI, 0.33–\\n0.76), a disease-free interval of more than 12\\xa0months (HR, 0.52; 95% CI, 0.36–\\n0.73), and newly metastatic disease (HR, 0.67; 95% CI, 0.46–0.99). The rate of \\nclinical benefit response was 84.9% in the palbociclib–letrozole group and 70.3% in \\nthe placebo–letrozole group [51]. However, overall survival data are immature.\\nRibociclib: LEE011 is another CDK4/6 inhibitor that has been tested in a phase \\nIII clinical trial in association with letrozole as a first-line treatment in postmeno-\\npausal women with HR+ advanced breast cancer (MONALEESA-2) [52]. Patients \\nwere randomized to ribociclib (600\\xa0mg/day; 3\\xa0weeks-on/1\\xa0week-off) plus letro-\\nzole (2.5\\xa0mg/day; continuous) or placebo plus letrozole until disease progression, \\nunacceptable toxicity, death, or treatment discontinuation. Median PFS was not \\nreached in the combination arm versus 16.4\\xa0months in the letrozole arm in patients \\nwith de novo advanced breast cancer (HR 0.45). The overall response rate was \\n41% in the ribociclib and letrozole combination arm versus 28% in the placebo \\nand letrozole arm.\\nIn MONALEESA-7, a phase 2 trial, ribociclib was studied in association with \\nNSAI/tamoxifen plus goserelin for premenopausal patients [53]. Adding the \\nCDK4/6 inhibitor ribociclib to standard first-line endocrine therapy significantly \\nprolonged survival in premenopausal and perimenopausal women with advanced \\nHR-positive, HER2-negative breast cancer. This is the first definitive evidence that \\nCDK4/6 inhibitor–based therapy is effective for first-line treatment of premeno-\\npausal and perimenopausal women.\\nAbemaciclib: Abemaciclib (Verzenio™) is an orally administered inhibitor of \\ncyclin-dependent kinases 4 and 6 that is being developed by Eli Lilly and Company. \\nIn the MONARCH-3 trial, abemaciclib in combination with an aromatase inhibi-\\ntor (letrozole or anastrozole) was compared with aromatase inhibitor monotherapy \\nin endocrine treatment naïve first-line HR+ advanced breast cancer patients [54]. \\n24 Endocrine Therapy of\\xa0Metastatic Breast Cancer 543\\nMedian PFS was found to be significantly prolonged in the abemaciclib arm (HR, \\n0.54; p\\xa0=\\xa00.000021; median: not reached in the abemaciclib arm, 14.7\\xa0months in \\nthe placebo arm). In patients with measurable disease, the objective response rate \\nwas 59% in the abemaciclib arm and 44% in the placebo arm (p\\xa0 =\\xa0 0.004). \\nComparing abemaciclib and placebo, the most frequent grade 3 or 4 adverse \\nevents were neutropenia (21.1% v 1.2%), diarrhea (9.5% v 1.2%), and leukopenia \\n(7.6% v 0.6%).\\nAlthough increased expression of cyclin D1 and pRb and decreased expression \\nof p16 (a natural CDK4/6 inhibitor) were found to be associated with response in \\nin\\xa0vitro preclinical studies, patient selection on the basis of cyclin D1 amplification \\nor p16 loss was not associated with an improved outcome from palbociclib treat-\\nment in the PALOMA-1/TRIO-18 trial [49, 55].\\nAnti-VEGF Monoclonal Antibody, Bevacizumab: Preclinical findings have \\nindicated that estradiol regulates angiogenesis under both physiological and patho-\\nlogical conditions. High VEGF levels in breast tumors have been shown to be related \\nto a decreased response to endocrine agents [10]. Bevacizumab has been extensively \\nevaluated in the treatment of HR+ and negative breast cancer in several trials. In \\n2014, Kümler et\\xa0al. performed a meta-analysis of 14 phase III trials in which beva-\\ncizumab was investigated [56]. More than 4400 patients with advanced breast can-\\ncer had benefits in relapse rate and PFS; however, no trial demonstrated an OS \\nadvantage. Recently, the results of 2 phase III trials have been published [57, 58]. In \\nthe LEA trial, the addition of bevacizumab to letrozole or fulvestrant in the first-line \\nsetting was studied for postmenopausal women with HR+ HER2-negative advanced \\nbreast cancer [57]. The time to treatment failure and OS were comparable in the \\ntreatment arms, although ORR was improved with the bevacizumab combination. In \\nthe CALGB 40503 trial, bevacizumab plus letrozole was compared with letrozole \\nmonotherapy. PFS was improved with the combination (20\\xa0months versus 16\\xa0months, \\nHR:0.74; p\\xa0=\\xa00.016) [58]. Unfortunately, OS was similar between the 2 treatment \\narms at the cost of a higher frequency of grade 3 or 4 toxicities with bevacizumab- \\nbased treatment regimens. Thus, bevacizumab is not currently recommended in \\ncombination with ET in HR+ advanced breast cancer patients.\\n Second-Line Treatment\\nUntil recently, there were insufficient data to guide the optimal sequence of therapy \\nin the second-line and subsequent settings. However, PFS and OS data from several \\nclinical trials including endocrine agents and targeted drugs have been published \\nrecently. Ovarian ablation or ovarian function suppression should be recommended \\nto all premenopausal women to facilitate treatment with endocrine agents approved \\nonly for postmenopausal women. For premenopausal patients who have been treated \\nwith an ovarian function-suppressing agent, serum estradiol levels should be mea-\\nsured to confirm that menopausal status is maintained. In the case of estradiol levels \\n544 F. Sen and A. Aydiner\\nin the premenopausal range with ovarian suppression, ovarian ablation via surgery \\nor radiation should be offered.\\nTamoxifen: Limited data have demonstrated the clinical benefit of tamoxifen in \\nthe second-line setting. In a combined analysis of 2 randomized trials evaluating \\nthe sequence strategy, such as tamoxifen followed by anastrozole or vice versa, \\nthe\\xa0overall response rate was 10%, and the clinical benefit rate (overall response rate \\nand stable disease ≥6\\xa0months) was 49% in 137 patients who crossed over to tamoxi-\\nfen [59].\\nAromatase Inhibitors: As second-line ET, there is no specific AI that has shown \\nsuperior activity in terms of PFS or OS compared to any other AI [60].\\nSwitching AIs: Total cross-resistance is lacking between steroidal (exemestane) \\nAIs and NSAIs as far as their anti-tumoral efficacy is concerned. Thus, upon pro-\\ngression of metastatic disease following treatment with NSAIs, exemestane may \\nbe effective as sequential hormone therapy or vice versa [61, 62]. The clinical \\nbenefit of exemestane after progression on a NSAI was supported by the findings \\nof a systemic review published in 2011 [63]. On average, 25–30% of patients in \\nthe crossover studies experienced objective response or stable disease for 6\\xa0months \\nor more.\\nFulvestrant: In second-line setting trials, fulvestrant was used at a lower dose \\n(250\\xa0mg monthly) than in current clinical practice and had no OS or overall response \\nrate advantage compared to AIs [36, 64]. Furthermore, the combination of fulves-\\ntrant with steroidal or NSAIs as a second-line treatment option did not provide any \\nPFS advantage over AI monotherapy or fulvestrant monotherapy [65]. Currently, \\nfulvestrant in combination with other endocrine agents is not a recommended \\napproach for second-line endocrine treatment.\\nThe strategy of increasing the dose of fulvestrant has been explored in patients \\nwith prior exposure to ET.\\xa0The phase III, multicenter CONFIRM trial randomized \\npostmenopausal patients with HR+ advanced breast cancer who received tamoxifen \\nor AI and experienced disease progression to receive 500\\xa0mg or 250\\xa0mg of fulves-\\ntrant on days 0, 14, 28 and every 28\\xa0days thereafter [66]. There were no clinically \\nimportant differences in serious adverse effect profiles between the treatment \\ngroups, and no clustering of serious adverse effects was detected in either treatment \\ngroup. The overall response rate and clinical benefit rate were similar between high \\nand low doses of fulvestrant. Although the absolute benefit in PFS was only one \\nmonth with the high dose, the PFS benefit reached statistical significance (HR:0.80; \\np\\xa0=\\xa00.006). A longer follow-up revealed a 4-month difference in favor of a higher \\ndose of fulvestrant [67]. The median OS was 26.4\\xa0months for fulvestrant 500\\xa0mg \\nand 22.3\\xa0months for 250\\xa0mg (HR\\xa0=\\xa00.81; p\\xa0=\\xa00.02). After this unique OS advantage, \\nfulvestrant at a dose of 500\\xa0mg has become the standard schedule in clinical practice \\nand clinical trials.\\n24 Endocrine Therapy of\\xa0Metastatic Breast Cancer 545\\nPI3K–Akt–mTOR Signaling Pathway: Accumulating evidence suggests that \\nboth the levels and activity of ER and PgR are dramatically influenced by growth- \\nfactor receptor (GFR) signaling pathways and that this crosstalk is a major determi-\\nnant of both breast cancer progression and response to therapy [68]. The PI3K \\npathway, a key mediator of GFR signaling, is one of the most altered pathways in \\nbreast cancer [10, 45]. For example, breast tumors may have mutation or loss of \\nPTEN or both, amplification and activating mutations in PIK3CA, amplification of \\nAkt2 and p70S6kinase, and overexpression of Akt3 [69]. Consistent with the muta-\\ntional spectrum of PI3K signaling intermediates in breast cancer, direct analysis of \\nPI3K activation has shown an association with poor outcome [70]. Similarly, loss of \\nPTEN is associated with low ER and PgR and poor outcome [71]. Recently, Generali \\net\\xa0al. demonstrated the significance of downregulation of key molecules in the PI3K \\npathway in response to letrozole, further emphasizing the predictive and therapeutic \\nrole of this pathway in ET [72].\\nInhibition of proliferation has been shown to be synergistically enhanced by the \\naddition of an mTOR inhibitor to endocrine treatment [73]. The Breast Cancer \\nTrials of Oral Everolimus-2 (BOLERO-2) study investigated the safety and efficacy \\nof the mTOR inhibitor everolimus in combination with exemestane in breast cancer \\npatients who had been previously treated with NSAIs [74]. The study showed that \\nconcomitant use prolonged PFS (median 7 versus 3\\xa0months; HR for mortality 0.43, \\n95% CI 0.35–0.54) and provided a higher overall response rate (9.5 versus 0.4%). \\nThe combination therapy resulted in a higher incidence of serious adverse events, \\nincluding stomatitis (8%), dyspnea (4%), noninfectious pneumonitis (3%) and ele-\\nvated liver enzymes (3%) compared with exemestane monotherapy and led to a \\nhigher percentage of treatment discontinuation [75]. There was no statistically sig-\\nnificant improvement in OS [76]. Given the remarkable PFS benefit, everolimus \\nwas approved by the FDA for the treatment of HR+ advanced breast cancer in com-\\nbination with exemestane after failure with NSAIs.\\nA phase III trial (HORIZON) was conducted in the first-line setting with temsi-\\nrolimus, another mTOR inhibitor [77]. Unfortunately, adding temsirolimus to letro-\\nzole did not improve PFS (median, 9\\xa0 months; HR, 0.90; 95% CI, 0.76–1.07; \\nP\\xa0=\\xa00.25) as first-line therapy in patients with AI-naïve advanced breast cancer nor \\nin the 40% patient subset with prior adjuvant endocrine therapy [77].\\nIn a randomized phase II study of neoadjuvant everolimus and letrozole versus \\nplacebo and letrozole, the addition of everolimus marginally improved the sono-\\ngraphic response rate (68% versus 59%, respectively; P\\xa0 =\\xa0 0.062) but markedly \\nenhanced the antiproliferative response (defined as the natural logarithm of percent-\\nage positive for Ki67 <1 on day 15 versus baseline; 57% versus 30%, respectively; \\nP\\xa0 <\\xa0 0.01) [78]. In TAMRAD, which was conducted by Groupe d’Investigateurs \\nNationaux pour I’Etude des Cancers Ovariens et du sein (GINECO) as a random-\\nized phase II trial of everolimus and tamoxifen versus tamoxifen alone in postmeno-\\npausal patients with advanced disease pre-exposed to AIs, the addition of everolimus \\nwas associated with a 4-month improvement in time to progression (median 9 ver-\\nsus 5\\xa0months, HR\\xa0=\\xa00.54, 95% CI 0.36–0.81) and reduced risk of death (HR 0.45, \\n546 F. Sen and A. Aydiner\\n95% CI 0.24–0.81) [79]. However, the overall response rates of the 2 arms were \\nsimilar (14 versus 13%). Furthermore, grade 3–4 stomatitis (11 versus 0%), anorexia \\n(7 versus 4%), and the incidence of pneumonitis were higher in combination \\ntherapy.\\nDrugs targeting other components of these pathways, including AKT inhibitors, \\nPIK3CA inhibitors (e.g., pictilisib) and dual kinase inhibitors targeting both mTOR \\nand PI3KCA, are currently in development.\\nNext-generation sequencing of BOLERO-2 did not show any relationship \\nbetween somatic mutation patterns, particularly in the catalytic subunit of PI3K3CA, \\nand clinical outcomes [80]. The progression-free survival benefit of everolimus was \\nmaintained regardless of the alteration status of PIK3CA, FGFR1, and CCND1 or \\nthe pathways of which they are components. However, quantitative differences in \\neverolimus benefit were observed between patient subgroups defined by exon- \\nspecific mutations in PIK3CA (exon 20 v 9) or by different degrees of chromosomal \\ninstability in the tumor tissues [80]. The data from this exploratory analysis suggest \\nthat the efficacy of everolimus is largely independent of the most commonly altered \\ngenes or pathways in hormone receptor-positive, human epidermal growth factor \\nreceptor 2-negative breast cancer. The potential impact of chromosomal instabilities \\nand low-frequency genetic alterations on everolimus efficacy warrants further inves-\\ntigation. Thus, the identification of predictive markers for PIK3CA/mTOR inhibi-\\ntion still needs to be addressed prospectively. Furthermore, PIK3CA mutational \\nstatus has been shown to be discordant between the primary tumor and metastases \\n[10]. In fact, mutational status is mainly analyzed in primary tumor samples. Thus, \\nalterations in molecular pathways should be re-analyzed in the metastatic setting.\\n CDK4/6 Inhibitors in\\xa0Second or Further Lines of\\xa0Treatment\\nThere is no evidence to recommend a CDK4/6 inhibitor as monotherapy or in com-\\nbination with other drugs in patients who received another CDK4/6 inhibitor in \\nprevious lines. However, CDK4/6 inhibitors are one of the most effective treatment \\noptions in patients who are CDK4/6 inhibitor naïve and have progressive disease \\nunder prior antiestrogen treatment.\\nPalbociclib in Combination with Fulvestrant: PALOMA-3 trial is a phase III \\nrandomized trial that included patients with HR+ and HER2- advanced breast can-\\ncer to compare palbociclib plus fulvestrant with placebo plus fulvestrant [47]. \\nPremenopausal women who were treated with goserelin were also included in the \\nstudy. Patients were required to have progressive disease during or within 12\\xa0months \\nafter completion of adjuvant ET or on prior ET in the metastatic setting (with pro-\\ngression from prior AI required for postmenopausal women). The study was stopped \\nearly due to significant efficacy results reported at interim analysis favoring fulves-\\ntrant plus palbociclib (median PFS: 9.2 versus 3.8\\xa0months; HR:0.42, 95% CI 0.32–\\n0.56; p\\xa0<\\xa00.001). Although higher rates of neutropenia and fatigue were reported in \\n24 Endocrine Therapy of\\xa0Metastatic Breast Cancer 547\\nthe combination arm, rates of discontinuation and febrile neutropenia were similar \\nbetween the 2 arms. Although longer follow-up is required to determine the impact \\nof combination therapy on OS, available PFS data support the use of palbociclib in \\ncombination with fulvestrant.\\nAbemaciclib with Fulvestrant: Abemaciclib at 150\\xa0mg twice daily plus fulves-\\ntrant has been approved in the USA for the treatment of HR+, HER2- advanced or \\nmetastatic breast cancer, in combination with fulvestrant in women with disease \\nprogression following endocrine therapy, and as monotherapy in adult patients with \\ndisease progression following endocrine therapy and prior chemotherapy in the \\nmetastatic setting based on the findings obtained in the phase 3 MONARCH 2 trial \\n[81]. PFS was significantly longer with abemaciclib plus fulvestrant than with ful-\\nvestrant alone (median, 16.4 v 9.3\\xa0months; HR, 0.553; p\\xa0<\\xa00.001). In patients with \\nmeasurable disease, abemaciclib plus fulvestrant achieved an ORR of 48.1% (95% \\nCI, 42.6–53.6%) compared with 21.3% (95% CI, 15.1–27.6%) in the control arm. \\nThe most common adverse events were diarrhea (86.4% v 24.7%), neutropenia \\n(46.0% v 4.0%), nausea (45.1% v 22.9%), and fatigue (39.9% v 26.9%) in the abe-\\nmaciclib versus placebo arms.\\n Further Lines of\\xa0Treatment\\nUntil recently, there were no sufficient data to guide further lines of ET.\\xa0 In the \\nMONARCH 1 trial, a phase II single-arm open-label study, patients with HR+/\\nHER2- MBC who had progressed on or after prior endocrine therapy and had 1 or \\n2 chemotherapy regimens in the metastatic setting were treated with abemaciclib \\n200\\xa0mg 2 times daily on a continuous schedule until disease progression or unac-\\nceptable toxicity [82]. Patients had a median of 3 (range, 1–8) lines of prior sys-\\ntemic therapy in the metastatic setting, 90.2% had visceral disease, and 50.8% had \\n≥3 metastatic sites. At the 12-month final analysis, the objective response rate was \\n19.7%; the clinical benefit rate (CR\\xa0+\\xa0PR\\xa0+\\xa0SD ≥6\\xa0months) was 42.4%, median PFS \\nwas 6.0\\xa0months, and median OS was 17.7\\xa0months. Diarrhea, fatigue, and nausea \\nwere the most frequent side effects, but discontinuations due to AEs were infrequent \\n(7.6%). In this poor-prognosis, heavily pretreated population with refractory HR+/\\nHER2- metastatic breast cancer, continuous dosing of single-agent abemaciclib was \\nwell tolerated and approved by the FDA.\\nPatients who progressed on 2 prior lines of ET should receive treatment based on \\ntheir individual clinical characteristics. Important factors affecting treatment deci-\\nsion include prior treatment response, duration of responses, tumor burden, risk of \\nvisceral crisis, and preferences of patients. In addition to tamoxifen, AIs and fulves-\\ntrant, progestins (e.g., megestrol acetate and medroxyprogesterone acetate), estro-\\ngens (e.g., diethylstilbestrol) and androgens (e.g., testosterone, fluoxymesterone \\nand danazol) are other endocrine treatment options for patients with HR+ advanced \\nbreast cancer who previously received the standard 2 lines of ET.\\n548 F. Sen and A. Aydiner\\nInsulin-Like Growth Factors (IGF-1 and IGF-2): Ganitumab is a monoclonal \\nIgG1 antibody that blocks IGF-1R.\\xa0 In a phase II double blind randomized con-\\ntrolled trial, the efficacy and safety of ganitumab in combination with endocrine \\ntherapy was investigated in postmenopausal patients with HR+ locally advanced \\nbreast cancer or MBC previously treated with endocrine agents [83]. Median PFS \\nwas similar between the ganitumab and placebo arms, and overall survival was \\nshorter in the ganitumab arm than in the placebo arm. Because the addition of gani-\\ntumab to endocrine treatment in women with previously treated HR+ advanced \\nbreast cancer did not improve outcomes, further studies of ganitumab in this sub-\\ngroup of patients have not been designed.\\nClass I Histone Deacetylases Inhibitors: Entinostat is a small-molecule inhibitor \\nof class I histone deacetylases, which have a key function in the control of gene \\nexpression. Entinostat exerts antiproliferative effects and promotes apoptosis in breast \\ncancer cell lines and has been evaluated as a second or later line of therapy in women \\nwith ER+ breast cancer. In the ENtinostat Combinations Overcoming REsistance \\n(ENCORE 301) randomized phase II trial, women who had previously progressed on \\nAI therapy and had multiple prior lines of therapy, including chemotherapy and endo-\\ncrine agents, were randomly assigned to receive exemestane 25\\xa0mg daily with entino-\\nstat 5\\xa0mg daily or with placebo [84]. The preliminary findings showed that exemestane \\nplus entinostat therapy improved PFS (median 4 versus 2\\xa0months) at the expense of \\ngreater fatigue (46 versus 26%) and uncomplicated neutropenia (25 versus 0%).\\nThere are several other targeted agents, including CDK inhibitors, FGFR inhibi-\\ntors (e.g., dovitinib), and heat shock protein 90 inhibitors, under evaluation in pre-\\nclinical and clinical studies.\\n Endocrine Therapy in\\xa0HER2-Positive and\\xa0Hormone Receptor- \\nPositive Breast Cancer\\nMutual effects of ER and HER2 have been demonstrated in several studies. The \\noverexpression of HER2 leads to resistance to established endocrine therapies. \\nThus, a combined therapeutic strategy might enhance endocrine effectiveness in \\npatients with HR+, HER2+ breast cancer but delay disease progression for those \\nwith HR+, HER2-negative tumors at risk of early relapse. This treatment strategy \\nhas been evaluated in many clinical studies.\\n Trastuzumab in\\xa0Combination with\\xa0Endocrine Therapy\\nIn an open-label, multicenter, 2-arm phase III trial, anastrozole monotherapy was \\ncompared with combination therapy of anastrozole with trastuzumab in HER2+, ER+ \\nbreast cancer patients [85]. Median PFS doubled in the anastrozole\\xa0+\\xa0 trastuzumab \\n24 Endocrine Therapy of\\xa0Metastatic Breast Cancer 549\\narm compared to anastrozole alone (4.8\\xa0 months vs 2.4\\xa0 months, respectively, \\nP\\xa0=\\xa00.0016). In the anastrozole-alone arm, 70% of patients were allowed to proceed to \\ntrastuzumab later in the course of disease. Overall survival, although not significantly \\ndifferent, was numerically superior in the combination arm (28.5 vs 23.9\\xa0 months, \\nP\\xa0=\\xa00.325).\\nKaufman et\\xa0al. investigated endocrine therapy in combination with anti-HER2 \\ntherapy in a randomized trial named “The Trastuzumab and Anastrozole Directed \\nAgainst ER+ HER2+ Mammary Carcinoma (TAnDEM)” [86]. Postmenopausal \\nwomen with HR+ and HER2+ MBC were randomized to receive anastrozole \\nalone or combination therapy with anastrozole and trastuzumab. Approximately \\ntwo thirds of patients on anastrozole alone received the combination treatment at \\nprogression. Treatment with trastuzumab plus anastrozole resulted in significantly \\n longer PFS compared with treatment with anastrozole alone (4.8 versus \\n2.4\\xa0months, respectively; HR 0.63; log-rank P\\xa0=\\xa00.0016). However, the median \\nOS was statistically similar between the treatment groups in both the overall and \\ncentrally confirmed HR+ subgroups, which may, in part, be explained by the high \\ncrossover rate [86].\\nThe addition of an AI to HER2-targeted therapy may delay the use of chemo-\\ntherapy in several patients and provides an important advantage. Based on these \\npositive results, trastuzumab (±pertuzumab) used concurrently with an AI has been \\napproved for treating postmenopausal patients with HR+ and HER2+ MBC who \\nhave not received prior trastuzumab. Based on conducted clinical trials, NSAIs have \\nbecome one of the standard treatment options in this patient population, but there is \\nno reason to believe that a different result would be obtained with a steroidal \\nAI.\\xa0Furthermore, there are no available data strongly supporting the use of tamoxi-\\nfen in combination with trastuzumab. However, based on the clinical evidence of \\nsuperiority of combination therapy in postmenopausal patients, tamoxifen in com-\\nbination with trastuzumab can be offered to premenopausal women who have HR+ \\nHER2+ advanced breast cancer.\\n Lapatinib in\\xa0Combination with\\xa0Endocrine Therapy\\nIn the first-line setting, the combination of lapatinib with letrozole was compared \\nwith letrozole plus placebo in patients with HR+ advanced breast cancer. In HER2+ \\npatients, lapatinib plus letrozole led to longer median PFS than letrozole plus pla-\\ncebo (8.2 versus 3\\xa0months; HR 0.71; p\\xa0=\\xa00.019) [87]. In patients with centrally \\nconfirmed HR+, HER2-negative disease (n\\xa0=\\xa0952), lapatinib plus letrozole arm did \\nnot improve PFS.\\nThe FDA approved lapatinib in combination with letrozole for the treatment of \\npostmenopausal women with HR+ MBC overexpressing the HER2 receptor for \\nwhom hormonal therapy is indicated. However, lapatinib in combination with an AI \\nhas not been compared to a trastuzumab-containing chemotherapy regimen for the \\ntreatment of MBC.\\n550 F. Sen and A. Aydiner\\nRecently, the results of the CALGB 40302 trial were published. The authors \\ninvestigated whether lapatinib would improve PFS among women with HR+ MBC \\ntreated with fulvestrant [88]. Adding lapatinib to fulvestrant did not improve PFS or \\nOS in ER+ advanced breast cancer and led to greater toxicity [88].\\nIn conclusion, the combination of an anti-HER2 agent with endocrine therapy is \\nan active and safe method with favorable response rates and survival advantages in \\npatients with HR+ and HER2+ advanced breast cancer. There are several other tar-\\ngeted agents, including CDK inhibitors with anti HER2 and endocrin agents, under \\nevaluation in preclinical and clinical studies.\\n Conclusion\\nIn conclusion, the major determinants of the treatment plan include the number \\nof lesions, extent of visceral involvement, receptor status of the primary lesion, \\nsites of recurrence and metastasis, and previous response to endocrine treat-\\nment. The combination of an anti-HER2 agent with endocrine therapy is an \\nactive and safe method with favorable response rates and survival advantages in \\npatients with HR+ and HER2+ advanced breast cancer. The combination of \\nexemestane with everolimus can be considered for patients who progressed \\nwithin 12\\xa0months on a non-steroidal AI or on tamoxifen at any time. Fulvestrant \\ncan be used as the first choice in de novo metastatic disease not previously \\ntreated with any endocrine treatment. Cyclin inhibitors in combination with an \\naromatase inhibitor or fulvestrant may be considered a treatment option for \\nfirst-line or second-line therapy for postmenopausal patients with ER-positive, \\nHER2-negative breast cancer.\\nBox 24.1\\nThe definition of menopause. Menopause can be defined as natural meno-\\npause (no menses for 12\\xa0months before starting chemotherapy or hormone \\ntherapy) or as menopause with ovarian ablation or suppression. Luteinizing \\nhormone (LH), follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), and serum estradiol (E2) \\nlevels should be at postmenopausal levels and should be measured before \\nsystemic treatment unless oophorectomy has been performed with hysterec-\\ntomy in women aged 60\\xa0years or younger.\\nThe definition of menopause: “Prior bilateral oophorectomy” OR \\n“Age\\xa0≥\\xa0 60\\xa0 years” OR “Age\\xa0 <\\xa0 60\\xa0 years” and amenorrheic for 12 or more \\nmonths in the absence of chemotherapy, tamoxifen, toremifene, or ovarian \\nsuppression and follicle- stimulating hormone (FSH) and estradiol in the post-\\nmenopausal range OR “If taking tamoxifen or toremifene, and age <60\\xa0years, \\nthen FSH and plasma estradiol levels in postmenopausal ranges”.\\n24 Endocrine Therapy of\\xa0Metastatic Breast Cancer 551\\nReferences\\n 1.

In patients diagnosed with early breast cancer, the incidence of \\nbone metastasis reaches 8% at 2\\xa0years and 27% at 10\\xa0years of follow-up. The risk of \\nbone metastasis in early-diagnosed breast cancer is associated with early diagnosis \\nage (<35\\xa0years), tumor size larger than 2\\xa0cm, and metastasis to greater than 4 axil-\\nlary lymph nodes in pathology [1]. Historically, the reported incidence of bone \\nmetastasis is 70%, and skeletal event-related morbidity is estimated at 2.2–4% per \\nyear [2]. Although bone-only metastatic disease has a better prognosis than visceral \\nmetastatic disease does, the morbidity and decreases in quality of life due to symp-\\ntomatic bone metastasis should not be underestimated.\\nPain, pathologic fractures, hypercalcemia and spinal cord compression are \\nnamed together as skeletal-related events (SRE) and contribute to the morbidity of \\nbone metastasis of breast cancer. SRE creates a major symptom burden and decrease \\nin quality of life by limiting daily instrumental activities, causing pain and requiring \\nsurgery or palliative radiotherapy.\\nThis chapter focuses on the mechanism of bone metastasis, the impact of bone \\nmetastasis on the treatment and follow-up of breast cancer patients, bone-targeted \\ntreatment options and prevention in advanced metastatic breast cancer patients \\nwithout bone metastasis.\\nE.

Cicin\\n Pathophysiology of\\xa0Bone Metastasis in\\xa0Breast Cancer\\nNormally, bone health is a dynamic process that is internally coordinated by the equi-\\nlibrium of osteoblasts and osteoclasts. A variety of local growth factors, chemokines \\nand systemic proteins are responsible for this equilibrium. Osteoblasts are derived \\nfrom mesenchymal cells and, under the influence of chemical factors, differentiate \\ninto mature osteocytes to create the bony matrix. By contrast, osteoclasts are derived \\nfrom monocytes, are responsible for bone resorption and are coordinated by local \\nfactors in the bone microenvironment. The major influence on osteoclasts is receptor \\nactivator of nuclear factor (NF)-KB ligand (RANK-L). Under normal conditions, \\nRANK-L binds to an extracellular receptor on osteoclasts and activates intracellular \\nsignaling, which is essential for survival. Osteoprotegerin is a negative regulator of \\nRANK-L that is responsible for inhibiting the function and differentiation of osteo-\\nclasts. A study showed that tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-related apoptosis-inducing \\nligand secreted from tumor cells is associated with osteoprotogerin and enhances \\nosteoclast survival [3]. Thus, the generation of osteoblasts and osteoclasts is strictly \\nregulated, especially by local factors of the bone microenvironment.\\nAs in any organ, the development of bone metastasis is not a random process but \\nrather a cascade of events in which the expression of multiple genes and various pro-\\nteins and aberrant intracellular signaling occur [4]. In an important pivotal study, che-\\nmokine receptor type 4 (CXCR4) and matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-1 were shown \\nto be crucial for homing of breast cancer cells to bone [5]. For many reasons, bone is \\nan appropriate substrate for breast cancer cells. First, bone is a highly vascular organ, \\nand bone marrow requires high blood flow. Second, intramedullary acidity, oxygen \\nlevels and extracellular calcium levels favor the maintenance of metastatic cells. \\nFinally, the bone microenvironment includes various growth factors, chemokines and \\nenzymes that create a suitable home for cancer cells, that is, a metastatic niche [6].\\nIn bone metastasis, the delicate equilibrium between osteoblasts and osteoclasts \\nis disturbed. Whether osteolytic or osteoblastic metastasis, the final cost is bone \\nfragility and instability. Although breast cancer has a reputation for osteolytic bone \\nmetastasis, in reality, 48% of breast cancer bone metastases are reported to be purely \\nlytic, 38% to be mixed and 13% to be purely osteoblastic. Therefore, both blastic \\nand resorptive processes are involved in breast cancer bone metastasis [7].\\n Targeting Bone Metastasis in\\xa0Metastatic Breast Cancer\\n Preventing Skeletal-Related Events Due\\xa0to\\xa0Bone Metastasis\\n Targeting with\\xa0Bisphosphonates\\nBisphosphonates are an important class of medications that inhibit bone resorp-\\ntion by inducing osteoclast apoptosis. First-generation, non-nitrogen bisphos-\\nphonates accumulate intracellularly, and an analogue of ATP is formed that \\n25 Bone-Targeted Therapy in\\xa0Advanced Breast Cancer 559\\nresults in apoptosis of osteoclasts [7]. Nitrogen-containing (N) bisphosphonates \\n(pamidronate, ibandronate and zoledronic acid) target signaling proteins of \\nosteoclasts that are important for cell survival [8]. In addition, experiments have \\nshown that higher concentrations of N-bisphosphonates inhibit osteoblasts, epi-\\nthelial and endothelial cells and breast cancer cells. Hence, the antitumoral prop-\\nerties of N-bisphosphonates may include multicellular pathways of inhibition \\n[8]. Moreover, the integration and interaction of T cells, bone, osteoblasts and \\nosteoclasts with N-bisphosphonates have been explained via immune mecha-\\nnisms [9].\\nThe effects of bisphosphonates have been extensively studied over the previous \\ntwo decades due to the high burden of SREs in the course of advanced breast cancer \\n(ABC). In a 2017 Cochrane meta-analysis, 44 randomized controlled studies involv-\\ning more than 37,000 women were analyzed [10]. In bone metastatic breast cancer \\npatients, SREs were reduced by 14% with bisphosphonates, and the first SRE was \\ndelayed by a median ratio of 1.43, with a moderate reduction of bone pain. Quality \\nof life scores were slightly better with bisphosphonates, and overall survival was not \\naffected by bisphosphonates.\\nWhether the effects of bisphosphonates are consistent with a class effect or \\nwhether there are any differences among bisphosphonates is an ongoing debate. \\nOne problem is that the methodology and expressions of SKE differ between stud-\\nies. Rosen et\\xa0 al. published a head-to-head comparison study of zoledronic acid \\n(ZA) [4–8\\xa0mg, intravenous (iv)] and pamidronate (90\\xa0mg, iv) every 3–4\\xa0weeks for \\nup to 2\\xa0years in 1130 patients [11]. A protocol modification was needed due to \\nconcerns of renal toxicity for 8\\xa0mg ZA.\\xa0After the dose was established, 4\\xa0mg ZA \\nwas shown to be noninferior to 90\\xa0mg pamidronate in terms of SRE excluding \\nhypercalcemia. In the osteolytic metastasis subgroup, the skeletal morbidity rate \\nand time to first SRE were lower when ZA was combined with radiotherapy or \\nendocrine treatment, thus confirming the synergistic efficacy of N-bisphosphonates. \\nMore recently, oral ibandronic acid (IBA) was compared to ZA in the ZICE phase \\nIII trial, and oral IBA was found to be inferior with respect to the SRE rate end-\\npoint [12].\\nThe remaining questions are the duration of bisphosphonate treatment and the \\noptimal time interval. For the optimal duration of bisphosphonates, there is a pau-\\ncity of clinically relevant data. Two years, which is usually set as the duration in \\nclinical trials, may be chosen, but continuation after 2\\xa0 years is also an option. \\nAccording to the American Society of Clinical Oncolgy (ASCO) 2017 updated \\nguidelines, the use of bisphosphonates is reserved for patients with evident bone \\nmetastasis [13]. There is no advice regarding the choice of one bisphosphonate \\nover another. If ZA is chosen, regimens of 4\\xa0mg every 3–4\\xa0weeks as well as every \\n12\\xa0weeks are suggested by the advisory board. The results of three randomized \\ncontrol trials were in favor of 12-week scheduling of iv ZA [14–16]. The advisory \\nboard addressed that bisphosphonates should not be used solely for bone pain \\nsince the effects are modest; instead, adjunct therapies such as radiotherapy, endo-\\ncrine agents for hormone receptor-positive patients, and pain medications should \\nbe included.\\n560 E. Esin and I. Cicin\\n Targeting RANK-L\\nThe major signal of osteoclastic survival is receptor activator of nuclear factor \\n(NF)-KB ligand (RANK-L). Denosumab is a fully human monoclonal antibody \\ndeveloped against RANK-L. Preclinical studies have proven that denosumab is \\neffective against osteoclast-induced bone destruction [17, 18].\\nA set of trials of patients with breast cancer, prostate cancer and other cancers \\nexcluding breast and prostate cancer was conducted to demonstrate the importance \\nof denosumab in bone metastasis [19–21]. In a landmark study by Stopeck et\\xa0al., \\nsubcutaneous (sc) 120\\xa0mg denosumab was tested against iv 4\\xa0mg ZA every 4\\xa0weeks \\n[21]. The primary endpoint was defined as delay of first SRE in the study. Denosumab \\nmet the criteria, as the median time to development of SRE with denosumab was \\n32.4\\xa0months vs. 26.4\\xa0months with ZA and it was shown to be noninferior to ZA \\n(HR: 0.82, p\\xa0=\\xa00.001). In addition, bone metastasis-related pain, which was set as a \\nsecondary endpoint, developed later with denosumab than ZA (HR: 0.78, p\\xa0=\\xa00.002). \\nCochrane analyses showed that denosumab reduced the risk of developing SRE by \\n22% [10].\\nAs a result, ASCO recommends denosumab as a first-line option at the first sign \\nof metastasis to bone [22].\\n Preventing Bone Metastases in\\xa0Advanced Breast Cancer \\nWithout Clinically Evident Skeletal Involvement\\nAs far as the burden of bone metastasis is concerned, it is important to prevent skel-\\netal involvement in advanced cancer patients without skeletal involvement. Three \\nstudies were included in Cochrane meta-analyses. Kanis et\\xa0al. showed that clodro-\\nnate use was associated with a decreased risk of bone metastases (p\\xa0<\\xa00.005); how-\\never, there was no survival benefit [23]. Pamidronate was tested, but there was no \\nsignificant efficacy in skeletal morbidity, quality of life and survival [24]. In conclu-\\nsion, the Cochrane meta-analyses reported that supportive bisphosphonates did not \\naffect the primary endpoint of reducing SRE [10]. Given the available data regard-\\ning bisphosphonates in ABC without osseous involvement, ASCO does not support \\ntheir use without any clinically evident bone metastases [22].\\n Toxicity Related to\\xa0Bone-Targeted Therapy\\nBisphosphonates and denosumab share common side effects. In general, they \\nmay result in acute-phase reactions, hypocalcemia, and osteonecrosis of the jaw \\n(ONJ). Oral bisphosphonates may result in some degree of gastrointestinal irrita-\\ntion. Occasionally, subcutaneous local reactions may be seen with denosumab. \\nIn randomized studies, both medications resulted in serious side effects at the same \\n25 Bone-Targeted Therapy in\\xa0Advanced Breast Cancer 561\\nrates, and the reported treatment discontinuation rates due to adverse events were \\nsimilar for both agents [25]. Bisphosphonates are associated with renal toxicity. The \\nrenal toxicity of ZA may be reversible, but pamidronate is associated with nephrotic \\nsyndrome, which may not be reversible [26, 27]. By contrast, denosumab is rela-\\ntively safe in renal aspects compared to bisphosphonates. In patients with normal \\nfunction and in patients with a decreased glomerular filtration rate, denosumab can \\nbe safely administered without any dose change [13, 28–30]. To avoid \\nbisphosphonate-i nduced nephrotoxicity, patients should be screened for glomerular \\nfiltration rate (GFR) before each bisphosphonate application, and bisphosphonates \\nshould not be given if the GFR is below 30\\xa0ml/min. Bisphosphonates have a rela-\\ntively lower risk of developing hypocalcemia compared to denosumab [21] The risk \\nof denosumab-a ssociated hypocalcemia is higher if the GFR is less than 30\\xa0ml/min.\\nONJ is one of the most debilitating complications of bone targeting in malig-\\nnancies. The risk of ONJ increases continuously with repeated doses and shorter \\nintervals of bone-targeted agent use [31]. No statistically significant difference \\nwas observed in ONJ rates between denosumab and bisphosphonates [31, 32]. In \\nCochrane analyses, the reported ONJ rate was increased by less than 0.5% com-\\npared to use in the adjuvant setting [10]. To avoid ONJ, preventive measures \\nshould be taken, such as oral hygiene, regular tooth control and avoiding dental \\nprocedures.\\n Conclusion\\nBone metastatic disease has a favorable prognosis compared to visceral metastatic \\ndisease. However, the morbidity and decrease in quality of life due to possible skel-\\netal events (pain, pathologic fractures, hypercalcemia and spinal cord compression) \\nmay have a large impact overall. Bisphosphonates inhibit bone resorption by induc-\\ning apoptosis of osteoclasts, and denosumab acts as a monoclonal antibody against \\nreceptor activator of nuclear factor (NF)-KB ligand, which is essential for osteoclast \\nsurvival. Given the available data regarding bisphosphonates in ABC without osse-\\nous involvement, international guidelines do not support the preventive use of bone-\\ntargeted agents. Toxicities of bisphosphonates and denosumab include hypocalcemia, \\nrenal toxicity, gastrointestinal disturbance and osteonecrosis of the jaw and should \\nbe carefully reviewed when administering drugs and making decisions about dose, \\ninterval and duration.\\nReferences\\n 1.

The median \\nis indicated by the symbols Q2 or Med. Values dividing serial terms into 4 equal \\nparts are called quartiles, values dividing into 10 equal parts are called decimals, \\nand values dividing into 100 equal parts are called percentiles. The 2nd quartile, 5th \\ndecimal and 50th percentile values correspond to the median value. Quartiles, deci-\\nmals and percentiles are calculated in the same way as the median.

Disci\\n Probability Distribution\\nThe values of the characteristics-variables (e.g., age, blood pressure, life span) can \\nbe presented as frequency distributions. The frequency distribution that summarizes \\nthe values for the random variable is called the “probability distribution”. There are \\nmany theoretical probability distributions in statistics. The most commonly used \\nprobability distributions in Medicine are the “Binom”, “Poisson” and “Normal \\n(Gaussian)” distributions. The Binom and Poisson distributions are discrete, and the \\nNormal distribution is in a continuous pattern.\\n Probability\\nProbability is the measure of the likelihood that an event will occur. It is obtained \\nby dividing the number of cases of “success” recorded during the emergence of \\nan event in different forms under the same conditions divided by the number of \\npossible states; the successful cases or situations are called the “probability \\nvalue”.\\n Probability of\\xa0Independent Events\\nThis rule is valid for events independent of each other. If one of the two events does \\nnot affect the likelihood of the occurrence of the second event, it is said that these \\nevents are independent. The probability that A and B co-occur is calculated as \\nfollows:\\nP(AandB\\n ) = P (A) ×P (B)  \\n Probability of\\xa0Dependent Events\\nThe probability that A and B co-occur is calculated as follows:\\nP(AandB) = P (A) ×PA(B )  \\nHere, the PA (B) symbol indicates the probability of the occurrence of event B after \\nevent A has occurred.\\n26 Biostatistical and\\xa0Epidemiological Terms Frequently Used in\\xa0Breast Cancer Research 569\\n Addition Rules for\\xa0Probability\\nThis is valid for events that are compatible and means that it is possible for the \\nevents to occur together. If A and B are two compatible events, the probability of the \\noccurrence of A or B is calculated as follows:\\nP(AorB) = P (A) + P (B) - P (AandB\\n )  \\nHere, P (A and B) indicates the probability of the co-occurrence of events A and B.\\n Theoretical Sampling Distribution\\nThis is the distribution of the means of all samples in size (n), which can be taken from \\na masterbatch. Such a distribution indicates the likelihood of occurrence of certain \\nmean values in a fixed-size sample that can be pulled from a masterbatch. For the \\nmean, the theoretical sampling distributions can be established for parameters such as \\nthe standard deviation of the population or the rate of a particular property.\\n Standard Error\\nThe standard deviation of the theoretical sampling distribution is called the “stan-\\ndard error”.\\n“Standard error” and “standard deviation” should not be confused with each \\nother. The standard deviation measures the variability between observation results \\nfor a population (σ) or for a sample in a given population, whereas the standard error \\nis the measure of variability between the means of the (n) sized samples taken from \\nthe population. In other words, the standard error refers to how the determined mean \\nvalues may vary from one sample to another.\\nThe standard error is usually calculated by one of the following formulas:\\ns (P ×Q)\\n,\\n n n  \\n Sampling\\nSelection of a subgroup according to certain rules that can represent the whole mas-\\nterbatch (universe) to conduct observations and examinations and generalizing the \\nresults to the universe is called “sampling”. It is inevitable that there will be \\n570 R. Disci\\nsignificant deviations and misstatements in a generalization based on a sample that \\ndoes not have the power of representation of the universe. For this reason, care \\nshould be taken to comply with certain rules and to implement certain conditions \\nduring sampling.\\n Random Sampling (Probabilistic Sampling)\\nThis is a type of sampling in which subjects are selected by the probability rules of \\nthe selection process. In random sampling, the probability of selecting each subject \\nin the sample is equal.\\n Sample Size (n)\\nTo make a correct prediction, it is necessary to calculate the minimum number of \\nsubjects that should be examined in the study group (sample). To calculate the sam-\\nple size (n), the researcher first needs to determine the maximum value of the differ-\\nence between the sample statistics and the parameters of the universe (acceptable \\nsampling error). The acceptable sampling error must as low as possible to obtain \\nsensitive and highly predictable results. In the study to be performed, the acceptable \\nsampling error can be reduced by increasing the sample size. However, since \\nincreasing the sample size will increase the difficulty of the scientific study, the \\nresearcher must balance the working conditions and the accuracy and sensitivity of \\nthe results.\\n Estimate\\nHere, the value of particular parameters in the masterbatch is estimated by an \\napproach moving from the tangential to the summit, with a mean or a rate of a \\nselected sample.\\n Confidence Interval (CI)\\nMoving from the average value calculated in a sample while estimating the mean of \\nthe universe, the variability that exists from one sample to another is taken into \\naccount, and an estimation is made within a certain interval called the “confidence \\ninterval”.\\n26 Biostatistical and\\xa0Epidemiological Terms Frequently Used in\\xa0Breast Cancer Research 571\\n Hypothesis\\nA hypothesis is a proposition that is deemed to be valid and designed to relate or \\nlink events to specific causes. In the context of biostatistics, an assumption can be \\nsaid to be a proposition designed between the parameters of the universe and the \\nstatistical values obtained for samples. In biostatistics, assumption tests are used to \\ncompare the statistical measures of different samples between themselves or to \\ncompare their parameters with the parameters of the universe.\\n Zero Assumption (Assumption of\\xa0Indifference) (Null \\nHypothesis) Ho\\nThis assumption proposes that the difference between the values we want to com-\\npare is actually (0); it differs from zero in practice, suggesting that this difference is \\nonly accidental.\\n(example: H0: x = m  or H0: x \\uf02d \\uf06d \\uf03d 0)\\n Alternative Hypothesis (H1)\\nThe difference between the values that we want to compare is actually different than \\n(0), which suggests that there is a reason for the difference other than coincidental \\ncauses [4–6].\\n(example: H1: x ¹ m  or H1: x \\uf02d \\uf06d \\uf0b90)\\nAs a result of hypothesis testing, the researcher will either agree that there is no \\nreal difference between the compared values and thus find correctness (accept Ho) \\nor will reject it (reject Ho) and argue that the difference between the values exam-\\nined is so great that it cannot be accidental.\\n Testing the\\xa0Hypothesis, Type 1 Error, Type 2 Error and\\xa0Power\\nTesting the Ho hypothesis will result in four ultimate situations rather than two. As \\ncan be clearly seen from the chart, the researcher will reach the correct conclusion \\nin two cases and the wrong conclusion in the other two (Table\\xa026.1).\\nThe misconceptions that a researcher who tests a null hypothesis may encoun-\\nter, which are referred to as “type 1 and 2 errors”, may be different from each \\nother in terms of scientific and practical consequences. The probability of type 1 \\nerror is indicated by the sign (α), and the probability of type 2 error is indicated \\n572 R. Disci\\nTable 26.1 Possible conclusions of hypothesis testing\\nReal situation\\nThe results of the hypothesis test Significant difference No difference\\nSignificant difference, H0 reject Correct result Type I error\\nNo difference, H0 accept Type II error Correct result\\nby (β). Another important definition in hypothesis testing is the concept of \\n“power”. Power is the probability of rejecting an inaccurate null hypothesis \\n(or accepting the correct alternative hypothesis). In another words, the power of a \\ntest indicates the ability to detect a difference that actually exists. The power is \\ncalculated as (1\\xa0−\\xa0β).\\n P Value and\\xa0Confidence Level\\nPrior to applying the statistical test, a selected and indeed valid null hypothesis is \\nindicated by the level of confidence (α), which measures the probability of rejection \\nby mistake. There is no doubt that (α) should be as small as possible for the results \\nto be valid. In this respect, values of (0.05), (0.01), or (0.001) are used for (α) in \\naccordance with common acceptance. As to the (p) value given in published scien-\\ntific studies, this value should be equal to or greater than the observed difference if \\nthe null hypothesis is true; in other words, the probability that the observed differ-\\nence will only be found incidentally. The (p) value is calculated after all tests have \\nbeen completed. If p < α, (Ho) is rejected [7, 8].\\n Correlation and\\xa0Regression\\nThese terms are used to show the relationship between two or more variables. The \\ndegree of the relationship is indicated by a number expressed as a correlation coef-\\nficient (relation coefficient). In addition, regression analysis is used to express the \\nshape of the relationship between two or more variables.\\nThe coefficient indicating the relationship between two continuous variables \\n(analyzed at the interval or proportional measurement level) is called the \\n “Pearson-B ravais moment product coefficient”. In Medicine, this coefficient is \\nreferred to as the coefficient of association and represented by the symbol r.\\nThe correlation coefficient (r) takes values between +1 and −1. If both variables \\nare changing in the same direction, the sign of r is positive; if one of the variables is \\nchanging in the opposite direction of the other (that is, if one is decreasing while the \\nother is increasing), the sign of r is negative. If there is no change in either the posi-\\ntive or negative direction between the variables, the correlation coefficient is zero. \\nA correlation coefficient equal to zero indicates that there is no relationship between \\n26 Biostatistical and\\xa0Epidemiological Terms Frequently Used in\\xa0Breast Cancer Research 573\\nthe variables. The absolute value of the correlation coefficient determines the power \\nof the relationship, and the sign specifies the direction of the relationship. For exam-\\nple, correlation coefficients of +0.95 and −0.95 indicate strong relationships at the \\nsame level. The direction of the correlation is positive for the first and negative for \\nthe latter. In the two-way table, the shape of dots (Scatter Diagram) gets closer to a \\nline as the r value approaches ‘+1’ or ‘−1’. As the distribution of the dots in a scatter \\ndiagram takes the shape of a circle, the absolute value of r decreases and becomes \\nzero when the dots are too messy.\\nIf the variables studied are not normally distributed and the variables are exam-\\nined only at the ranked measurement level, the Spearman ranking variation correla-\\ntion coefficient is calculated instead of the Pearson-Bravais moment product \\ncorrelation coefficient.\\nThe technique used to determine the relationship between variables varies \\naccording to the form of the relationship, as well as the number of variables involved \\nand the measurement results of these variables. Simple correlation techniques are \\nused in the correlation analysis between two variables, multiple correlation tech-\\nniques are used when the number of variables is three or more, and partial correla-\\ntion techniques are used in cases where the effect of some variables is kept \\nconstant.\\nThe relationship between variables can be in different forms. A relationship that \\ncan be expressed by a first-order mathematical equation (the line equation) is called \\na ‘linear relation’. In contrast, if there is no possibility of expressing the relationship \\nbetween variables with a first-order mathematical equation, then the relation is not \\nlinear, or there is a non-linear relationship. A non-linear relationship is expressed by \\na higher-order equation instead of a linear equation.\\n Coefficient of\\xa0Determination\\nThe determination coefficient (dy\\xa0⋅\\xa0x) indicates what percentage of the variance in ‘y’ \\ndepends on ‘x’ and is calculated by taking the square of the correlation coefficient.\\n Study Designs\\nWe can classify scientific studies according to their purpose or style of conducting \\nas follows:\\nObservational/Experimental\\nDescriptor/Analyzer\\nRetrospective/Prospective\\nThe types of studies frequently used in health sciences are as follows:\\n574 R. Disci\\n Case Series Studies\\nSimple descriptive statistics for a group of patients are obtained. Regarding the \\ndisease being investigated, the answers to the questions “who”, “where” and “when” \\nare sought. Various hypotheses are established based on the results obtained in the \\nstudy.\\n Cross-Sectional Studies\\nIn such studies, an event is examined by a questionnaire or general screening within \\na very short time period. After collecting the necessary data, researchers attempt to \\ndetermine the cause-result associations. Generally, the prevalence values of diseases \\n(the incidence of the disease in the society) are obtained in such studies (Fig.\\xa026.1).\\n Cohort Studies\\nThe cohort formed by the individuals to be monitored will be randomly divided into \\ntwo groups that will be exposed or not exposed to the factor. Both groups are moni-\\ntored for a certain period of time, and data about disease development are collected \\n(Fig.\\xa0 26.2). In such studies, the incidence of the disease (the emergence of new \\ncases with the particular disease during the time period examined), the relative risk \\nratio (relative risk, RR), and the attributable risk factor can be calculated. As the \\nrandomly formed groups are under monitoring, more accurate information about \\ndisease development can be obtained.\\nRandom sample\\nDisease (+)\\nNo disease (–)\\nPopulation (N) Sample (n)\\nFig. 26.1 Cross-sectional studies\\n26 Biostatistical and\\xa0Epidemiological Terms Frequently Used in\\xa0Breast Cancer Research 575\\nDisease (+)\\n(a)\\nDisease (–)\\nExposed (b)\\n(a+b)\\nDisease (+)\\n(c)\\nCohort Disease (–)\\n(a+b+c+d) Unexposed (d)\\n(c+d)\\nThe beginning of t\\nthe study\\nFig. 26.2 Cohort study\\n Case-Control Studies\\nIn Case-Control studies, the answer to the question “what happened in the past” is \\nsought. In this type of study investigating causal relationships, the past histories of \\ntwo groups of subjects, those who have a particular disease (study group) and those \\nwho do not (control group), are reviewed (Fig.\\xa026.3). Usually, the patient files in the \\nclinic constitute the research database. To conduct the research, the information \\nabout the disease and risk factors must be already recorded in the files. It is an \\nappropriate type of research for investigating the causes of rare diseases. To ensure \\nthat the groups are comparable, both groups should be homogeneous (similar) with \\nrespect to variables other than the presence of the disease.\\n Parallel-Controlled Clinical Study\\nPatients presenting to the clinic who are eligible for the study (patients fulfilling the \\ninclusion criteria specified in the study protocol) are randomly divided into two (or \\nmore) groups. One of these groups forms the experimental group, and the other \\nforms the control group (Fig.\\xa026.4). In the experimental group, a new drug or treat-\\nment method is used, whereas in the control group, placebo or traditional treatment \\nis applied.\\nBy comparing the treatment outcomes of the two groups, the results such as drug \\nefficacy and side effects are evaluated. To ensure that the groups are comparable, the \\nprocess of including patients in groups must be randomized. However, to reduce \\n576 R.

Blinding \\n(not being aware) is applied to prevent mistakes that may arise from bias (Table\\xa026.2).\\nIn single-blind studies, only the subjects are unaware of the group in which they \\nparticipate. In double-blind studies, both practitioners and patients are unaware of \\nwhich groups the patients are in. During the course of the statistical evaluation of \\nthe study results, if the data analyst does not know in which group the patients are \\ninvolved, the study is called triple blind.\\n Evaluation Criteria for\\xa0Diagnostic Tests\\nSensitivity This shows the percentage of subjects known to have actually devel-\\noped the disease that can be identified by the new method being tested.\\nSpecificity This shows the percentage of those who do not have the disease (those \\nwho are healthy) that can be identified by the method being tested.\\nGeneral Accuracy This shows the percentage of patients and healthy people who \\ncan be recognized by the method being tested.\\nPositive Predictive Value This demonstrates the percentage of positive results \\nindicating disease presence with the method tested (compliance with the known \\nmethod).\\nNegative Predictive Value This shows the percentage of the negative results indi-\\ncating the absence of disease with the method tested.\\nWe can also show the test results that are true positive (TP), false positive (FP), \\ntrue negative (TN) and false negative (FN) (Table\\xa026.3).\\n26 Biostatistical and\\xa0Epidemiological Terms Frequently Used in\\xa0Breast Cancer Research 579\\nTable 26.3 Real situation and test results\\nReal situation\\nTest result Disease (+) Disease (−) Total\\n(+) TP FP TP\\xa0+\\xa0FP\\n(−) FN TN FN\\xa0+\\xa0TN\\nTotal TP\\xa0+\\xa0FN FP\\xa0+\\xa0TN TP\\xa0+\\xa0FP\\xa0+\\xa0TN\\xa0+\\xa0FN\\nThe definitions can be expressed as follows:\\nSensitivity\\xa0=\\xa0TP/(TP\\xa0+\\xa0FN)\\nSpecificity\\xa0=\\xa0TN/(TN\\xa0+\\xa0FP)\\nTotal accuracy\\xa0=\\xa0(TP\\xa0+\\xa0TN)/(TP\\xa0+\\xa0FP\\xa0+\\xa0FN\\xa0+\\xa0TN)\\nPositive predictive value\\xa0=\\xa0TP/(TP\\xa0+\\xa0FP)\\nPositive predictive value\\xa0=\\xa0TN/(FN\\xa0+\\xa0TN)\\n Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) Curve\\nThis analysis method aims to use a variable that receives continuous values in a \\ngiven definition interval (continuous variable) as a diagnostic test. Sensitivity and \\n(1-specificity) values are calculated for various “positive limit values” (cutoff \\nvalues).\\nSensitivity is represented on the (y) axis, and (1-specificity) values are repre-\\nsented on the (x) axis. We plot the ROC curve using the sensitivity and (1- selectivity) \\ncoordinate values obtained for various cutoff values. The power of the diagnostic \\nvalue of the examined variable (the ability to distinguish between the patient and \\nhealthy subjects) is expressed by the area under the ROC curve (AUC). The diag-\\nnostic value increases as the area (AUC) approaches a value of 1. At a diagnostic \\npower of 100%, the AUC value equals ‘1’. The 95% confidence intervals (CI) of the \\nAUC are determined. If the value of 0.50 (theoretical discrepancy) is outside the \\nconfidence intervals, we may refer to a statistically significant diagnostic value.\\n Follow-Up Time and\\xa0Result Endpoints in\\xa0Survival Analysis\\nWe can show the start time, the monitoring time and the end time of monitoring as \\nfollows (Fig.\\xa026.7):\\nTwo of the most common problems in prospective follow-up studies are an \\ninability to fully monitor subjects during the research period and changes in treat-\\nment methods applied to patients in long follow-up durations. Patients who cannot \\nbe fully monitored for various reasons are taken into account for as long as they are \\nfollowed-up in the survival analysis. We can consider death, recurrence (disease \\nrecurrence), metastasis and any event that shows the treatment result as endpoints. \\n580 R.

If the variable is classified or ranked, the statistical analyses that \\ncan be performed are very limited. It is possible to use only non-parametric tests \\n(ranking statistical tests) at these measurement levels, whereas all parametric tests \\ncan be used at intermittent and proportional measurement levels. The most impor-\\ntant prerequisites for the use of parametric tests are that the variable examined has \\nto fit the normal distribution. If the normality condition is not fulfilled, it can be \\nresumed by transforming the examined variable into another variable that shows a \\nnormal distribution.\\nIf the number of subjects in the sample (sample size) is small, it is difficult to \\ndecide the distribution of the examined variable. Non-parametric tests are preferred \\nin this case. In non-parametric tests, the distribution type of the examined variable \\nhas no significance.\\nStatistical analyses and hypothesis tests that are valid at various measurement \\nlevels are presented in the following table (Table\\xa026.5):\\n Incidence of\\xa0a\\xa0Disease\\nThis shows the frequency of new cases emerging within the particular period.\\nNew cases emerged during monitoring\\nI =\\nPopulaion at risk\\n (number of subjects monitored)  \\n Relative Risk (RR)\\nIn a cohort (prospective) study, we can show the results as follows (Table\\xa026.6):\\nThe incidence of disease is compared between the risk factor-exposed and risk \\nfactor-unexposed groups to determine whether there is a relationship between the \\nrisk factor and the disease.\\nThe relationship between the risk factor and the disease is indicated by the \\n“Relative Risk” (RR), which indicates the contribution of the exposure to the risk \\nfactor to disease development.

Since the \\nincidence value cannot be calculated in case-control studies, RR cannot be calcu-\\nlated directly. In such studies, the odds ratio (OR) is calculated for the estimated RR \\nvalue.\\n Odds Ratio (OR)\\nIn case-control studies, we can show the study results as follows (Table\\xa026.7):\\nThe relationship between the disease and the agent is indicated by the “Relative \\nProportion” (Odds ratio, (OR)), which indicates the contribution of the causative \\nagent to disease development. OR is calculated as follows:\\na ×d\\nOR =\\n b ×c  \\nIf an event has two outcomes denoted by (A) and (B), the Odds value of a given \\noutcome is calculated as follows:\\n584 R.

The odds value (probability ratio) of disease occurrence in the \\ncausative agent (+) group is OR times higher than that in the causative agent (−) \\ngroup. The OR value is used as the estimated value of the RR calculated in the \\ncohort studies.\\n Hazard Ratio (HR)\\nThe relative risk (RR) calculated in prospective studies is shown as the hazard ratio \\n(HR) in survival analysis. The interpretations of the relative risk and the hazard ratio \\nare similar. When HR has a value close to 1 (“1” is included in between the confi-\\ndence intervals of the calculated HR), there is no statistically significant relationship \\nbetween the study group and the control group (reference group), whereas if HR is \\nless than or greater than 1, there is a statistically significant relationship.\\nReferences\\n 1.

The pathology of B-reast cancer includes metaplastic carcinoma, which is characterized by the differentiation of neoplastic epithelial cells into squamous and/or mesenchymal elements, including but not limited to spindle, chondroid, osseous, and rhabdoid cells [2]. These tumors may be entirely composed of metaplastic elements or may include a mixture of metaplastic and carcinomatous elements\n",

Patients present with a palpable mass, and grossly, these tumors are smaller than other forms of metaplastic carcinomas. They have a hard consistency and ill-defined borders, and squamous differentiation may be extensive, with large keratinizing cyst formations. In our experience, this rare tumor is an underdiagnosed entity and may be left untreated; during their long evolution, they recur and metastasize.\n",

The infiltrating squamous cells form sheets and nests with varying degrees of differentiation, and combinations of patterns with transitions to spindle cells or less differentiated forms may occur. These tumors are characterized by low genomic instability and share no copy number aberrations with other metaplastic carcinomas of the ovaries.

These tumors are characterized by low genomic instability and share no copy number aberrations with other metaplastic carcinomas of the ovaries.

              "76  n some clinical settings, the pathologist may continue to perform intraoperative pathological examination of sentinel lymph nodes (SLN) through either fine needle aspiration (FNA) or core biopsy methods. Each method has its advantages and disadvantages, with FNA being easy, rapid, and preserving tissue for subsequent block examination, but requiring experience and limitations in measuring detected metastasis. The use of both methods has been found to be satisfactory in some meta-analyses. However, completion of axillary lymph node dissection was not found to be superior to SLN biopsy alone regarding disease-free and overall survival in a randomized study. The frequency of intraoperative examination of SLN nodes in breast cancer patients who will undergo breast-conserving surgery and radiotherapy has decreased since a study showed that completion of axillary lymph node dissection was not superior to SLN biopsy alone regarding disease-free and overall survival  \n",

However, tissue for permanent pathological examination should be preserved for further analysis. All sentinel lymph nodes should be measured and sliced in 2-mm thicknesses after dissection of fatty tissue, either longitudinally or transversely.

The choice of treatment is based on tumor features, such as location and size, number of lesions, extent of lymph node involvement, and biology, including pathology and gene expression. Patients should be actively involved in all management decisions, and hereditary cancer should be explored if needed. Prophylactic procedures should be discussed following appropriate genetic counseling and testing, especially in younger premenopausal women, as possible fertility issues should be discussed, and guidance on fertility-preservation techniques should be provided before initiation of treatment.
